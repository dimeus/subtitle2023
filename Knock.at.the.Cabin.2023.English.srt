This is Eric.

175
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:17,750
Is there something
     we can help you with?

176
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:19,092
LEONARD:
           There is.

177
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:20,654
Why don't you open the door?

178
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,359
It'll be easier if we speak
         face-to-face.

179
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:23,866
WEN:
     Tell them to go away.

180
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,659
Please make them go away.

181
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:26,594
Wen, please.

182
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:29,003
Uh, we weren't expecting
           visitors.

183
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:31,940
I don't want to sound rude,
but we'd like to be left alone.

184
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,436
I understand.

185
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:35,405
And I'm sorry to intrude
       on your vacation,

186
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,243
especially in such
   a beautiful place as this.

187
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:39,475
Make them go away!

188
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,081
(quietly):
              Wen.

189
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:43,446
You should know that
this isn't easy for us, either.

190
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:45,921
None of us have been
      to this lake before.

191
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,824
And the four of us,
       we never thought

192
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:50,288
we'd be here talking
      to you nice people.

193
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:54,457
(chain rattles)

194
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:56,459
Who else is out there with you?

195
00:11:56,494 --> 00:11:58,461
I'm here with Sabrina, Adriane
          and Redmond.

196
00:11:58,496 --> 00:11:59,968
And the four of us are here

197
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:03,565
because we're trying to save
    a whole bunch of people.

198
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,039
Eric, come here. Come here.

199
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:07,239
LEONARD: But we need
     your help to do that.

200
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:09,208
We can't do anything
          without you,

201
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:10,770
and speaking through a door

202
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:14,081
is making a difficult
 conversation near impossible.

203
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:15,676
(whispers):
             What?

204
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,119
(chain rattling)

205
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:21,990
(whispering): There's a woman
      carrying something

206
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,684
that looks like a pick
          with a chain

207
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,752
and a mallet head at the end.

208
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:31,263

210
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:41,438
This can't be right.
     There's no dial tone.

00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:43,110
ERIC:
             What?

212
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:44,573
I checked it when we got here.

213
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:46,047
Is the battery dead?

214
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:47,642
ANDREW: The battery's not dead.
       It's not dialing.

215
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:52,152
LEONARD:
 Like I said, we need to talk.

216
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,022
We don't have a choice.

217
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:57,355
Yeah, well,
we don't have a choice, either!

218
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,719
We're calling the cops!

219

ADRIANE: Hey, um,
   we know you can't do that.

220
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:04,692
None of our phones get service
       out here, either.

221
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:08,003
And sorry,
 we had to cut the phone line.

LEONARD:
   We don't mean to rush you,

226
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:21,808
but we're a little pressed
           for time.

227
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,921
Please open the door so we can
   have a real conversation.

   do you... -Shh. -Wen, Wen.

Yes and no. It's in the safe
   in the back of the truck.

00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:44,663
I've never watched this show
   before, but-but I like it.

345
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:47,402
The characters, um,
  they seem curious and good.

346
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,164
I get the sense that it
  explores or teaches empathy

347
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,771
and tolerance,
    and that's just lovely.

348
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:57,269
Empathy and tolerance?

349
00:19:57,304 --> 00:19:58,974
Is that what you're here
         to talk about

350
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:00,976
now that you have the queers
            tied up?

351
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:02,912
(sighs):
              Oh.

352
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:05,046
Andrew, I assure you
      that we're not here

353
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:07,587
with hate or prejudice
   in our hearts. Not at all.

354
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:10,557
We don't have one
 homophobic bone in our bodies.

355
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:12,328
I don't hate anybody.

356
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:14,990
I do have conflicted feelings
       about this door.

357
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:16,189
(door clatters)

358
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:18,257
LEONARD:
   You have to believe that.

359
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:20,699
But we had no idea
  you were a single-sex couple

360
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:23,471
until we got here.

361
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:25,374
That one was a surprise.

362
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:29,103
Well, I guess if you promise,
  then I have to believe you.

363
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:32,348
I mean, we're normal people
        just like you.

364
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,417
-We have no choice.
   -There's always a choice!

365
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,948
ADRIANE:
     He's right about that.

366
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:42,457
Our choices make our destiny.

367
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,328
I almost got that tattooed.
        (laughs softly)

368
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:51,092
Okay, you're right, Andrew.

369
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,731
There's always a choice.

370
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:55,470
So we choose to be here.

371
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:58,407
Can everyone come in here,
            please?

372
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:00,541
It's almost time.

373
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:02,477
Time for what?

374
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,578
You don't need us tied up.

375
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:08,307
You said you were here to talk,
        so we'll talk.

376
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:11,354
(Andrew grunting)

377
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:18,988
(Sabrina exhales)

378
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:22,354
Hi, Eric, Wen...

379
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:23,564
(clears throat)

380
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,160
...and Andrew.

381
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,327
My name is Sabrina.

382
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:32,067
I live in Southern California.

383
00:21:32,102 --> 00:21:34,806
I live in a town
you've probably never heard of.

384
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:41,076
I have been a post-op nurse
    for almost five years.

385
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:45,311
I used most of my savings

386
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,379
to come out to Pennsylvania,

387
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:50,954
to come here to talk
         with you guys.

388
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:53,121
(shuddered breathing)

389
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:59,435
I have a little
    half sister back home...

390
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:04,198
...and, Wen,
 you kind of remind me of her.

391
00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:09,841
(Sabrina and Leonard
      clear their throats)

392
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:12,976
(clears throat)

393
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:15,781
Well, I think you-you guys
          already know

394
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:17,585
my name is Leonard.

395
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,719
And, uh,

396
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:21,919
I'm good at catching
   grasshoppers, right, Wen?

397
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:23,855
(grunts)

398
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:28,662
I'm from Chicago.

399
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:29,927
I'm a second grade teacher,

400
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:33,601
and I run
   the after-school program.

401
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:35,603
I'm also a bartender. I...

402
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:37,638
Okay. Me?

403
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:38,936
Am I next?

404
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:40,509
Hi there.

405
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:43,237
I'm Redmond, and I like
    long walks on the beach,

406
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:44,876
-and I like beer.
        -LEONARD: Hey.

407
00:22:44,911 --> 00:22:46,273
We already discussed this.

408
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,308
They deserve to know who we are.

409
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:53,379
We wasted time for this guy
          to wake up.

410
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,723
You know, this get-to-know-you
  stuff doesn't matter at all.

411
00:22:56,758 --> 00:23:00,727
Doesn't change what we have
 to do or what they have to do.

412
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:05,292
When you say stuff like that,
   you sound how you sound,

413
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:08,097
okay, you just scare them,
    you make it less likely

414
00:23:08,132 --> 00:23:11,001
that they'll believe us
         or cooperate.

415
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:14,510
Okay, okay, my turn it is.

416
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:17,271
I live in Medford,
         Massachusetts.

417
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:19,207
I work for the gas company,

418
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:23,046
making sure houses
 and apartments don't blow up.

419
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:26,016
I'm single,
    if you can believe that.

420
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:31,450
I've done some time,
          as they say.

421
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:36,092
Did a lot of, uh...

422
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:40,536
questionable stuff
  when I was young and stupid.

423
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:44,430
But I'm much better now.

424
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:50,843
And my father used to beat
      the shit out of me,

425
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:52,174
like Andrew just did.

426
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:56,816
Wish I could go back in time,

427
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:59,016
give the kid-me this thing.

428
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:01,788
May I speak now?

429
00:24:01,823 --> 00:24:03,416
I hope I don't sound confusing.

430
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:05,517
ERIC:
   Hold on, hold on a second.

431
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:07,255
Wh...

432
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,631
We get that you guys
    are a part of some group

433
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:13,800
and it sounds like,
 it sounds like you want to...

434
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:15,604
fix things.

435
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,232
To help.

436
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:18,739
ANDREW: Eric, you don't have
       to try to talk...

437
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:20,532
I... No, no, I'm okay.
      I want to say this.

438
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:24,745
If you're try...
     trying to recruit us,

439
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,615
I mean, why else bother

440
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,783
introducing yourselves to us,
            right?

441
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:36,119
If you're trying to change us
     or make us different,

442
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:38,957
all of this...

443
00:24:38,992 --> 00:24:41,355
(voice breaking):
      this isn't the way.

444
00:24:43,227 --> 00:24:45,359
Can someone put the curtain
       on the back door?

445
00:24:45,394 --> 00:24:46,932
What's wrong with Eric?

446
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:48,230
When you have a concussion,

447
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:49,770
you're extremely sensitive
           to light.

448
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:51,398
Well, there-there's nothing
   we can do about that now.

449
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:52,905
Well, he's only gonna
     get better if he rests

450
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,676
in a darkened room
 or if we make it dark in here.

451
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:56,370
We shouldn't move him
  until we make our proposal.

452
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:57,811
He might need to be
  in a darkened room for days,

453
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,879
-not just a few hours.
   -You're not separating me

454
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:01,243
from Andrew and Wen.

455
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:03,652
I'll see what I can do
       with the curtains.

456
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:04,983
So, whatever.

457
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:07,953
I'm, um, I'm Adriane.

458
00:25:07,988 --> 00:25:10,725
Yeah, I-I've been a lot
 of things, but-but right now,

459
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,729
or, um, before I got up here,
      I-I was a line cook

460
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:19,261
at a Mexican restaurant
   in-in Dupont Circle, D.C.

461
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:22,099
I love to feed people.

462
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:24,904
It feels like it's more
       than food to me.

463
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:27,533
Um, God, what else?

464
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,007
Uh...

465
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:32,043
Oh, I have, um, I have two cats.

466
00:25:32,078 --> 00:25:33,572
And you'd love them, Wen.

467
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:37,147
Their names are Riff and Raff.

468
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:39,215
Do you like cats, Wen?

469
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,789
You don't have to answer her,
           sweetie.

470
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:43,483
LEONARD:
          Sorry, Wen.

471
00:25:43,518 --> 00:25:45,353
Maybe I'll put it back on
         later, okay?

472
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:48,059
Forget the curtains.

473
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:50,094
It's time.

474
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:57,200
(insects chirring)

475
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:08,981
The four of us are here
   to prevent the apocalypse.

476
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:13,381
We-- and when I say "we,"
I mean everyone in this cabin--

477
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:17,220
can stop it from happening,
   but only with your help.

478
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:23,457
Ultimately,
 whether the world ends or not

479
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:26,801
is completely up to you three.

480
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:31,498
You are having a psychological
     break of some kind.

481
00:26:40,575 --> 00:26:43,785
Your family must choose
    to willingly sacrifice

482
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,149
one of the three of you

483
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:47,756
in order to prevent
        the apocalypse.

484
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,796
After you make what I know
   is an impossible decision,

485
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:57,623
you must then kill
      the one you choose.

486
00:27:00,903 --> 00:27:03,365
If you fail to choose,

487
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,743
or if you fail to follow through
      with the sacrifice,

488
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:10,174
the world will end.

489
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:13,540
You three will live,

490
00:27:13,575 --> 00:27:16,246
but the rest of humanity,

491
00:27:16,281 --> 00:27:21,119
seven billion plus...

492
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,615
will perish.

493
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,892
(Andrew's breath shuddering)

494
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,620
They're lunatics.

495
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,524
And you will all live
          long enough

496
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,770
to witness the horror
   of the end of everything.

497
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:39,907
And you will be left to wander
  the devastated planet alone.

498
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:46,342
Permanently
    and cosmically... alone.

499
00:27:47,818 --> 00:27:50,511
ERIC:
            Leonard.

500
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:53,613
We haven't done anything wrong.

501
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:55,351
I agree with you. You haven't.

502
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:59,685
You haven't done anything wrong
 to... to deserve this burden.

503
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:07,462
You're just the family chosen
 to decide for us in this time.

504
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,914
LEONARD: Look,
  we're not here to hurt you.

505
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,411
If we wanted to hurt you,
   we would've used duct tape

506
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:24,952
-instead of ropes.
           -You stop.

507
00:28:27,286 --> 00:28:28,956
You have to understand
         that we cannot

508
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:32,025
and will not choose who has
   to be sacrificed for you.

509
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,754
And just as importantly,
     we cannot act for you.

510
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:37,800
And you cannot kill yourselves.

511
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:40,693
We're not choosing anyone.

512
00:28:40,728 --> 00:28:42,794

 of everyone else in the world?

515
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:49,801
Yes. Even if I believe
    the world was at stake,

       -REDMOND: Christ.

             Okay,

526
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,564
you need to listen
       to this part, too.

527
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,302
I've been shown exactly
       what will happen

528
00:29:18,337 --> 00:29:20,403
if you choose not to make
         a sacrifice.

529
00:29:20,438 --> 00:29:22,669
We've all been shown.

530

We couldn't stop drawing
      the visions we saw.

I actually thought
  something was wrong with me,

532
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:32,019
but the visions were so strong,

533
00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:35,891
so specific and so, so real.

534
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:38,553
Sabrina, Adriane and Redmond,
  they had the visions, too.

535
00:29:38,588 --> 00:29:43,393
So, that led us
      to each other and...

536
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:46,759
and that led us here
      to this exact cabin.

537
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:50,301
We have no idea
      why we were picked.

First, the cities will drown.

540
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:06,317
The oceans will swell
 and rise up into a great fist

541
00:30:06,352 --> 00:30:09,353
and pound all the buildings
   and people into the sand,

542
00:30:09,388 --> 00:30:10,849
and drag everything out to sea.

543

        wrong with you,

      if you believe this.

545
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:18,494
Then a terrible plague
          will descend

546
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:19,825
and people will writhe
          with fever,

547
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,596

  A second massive earthquake

704
00:39:46,393 --> 00:39:48,096
has struck in the Pacific,

705
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:49,801
registering 8.6
     on the Richter scale.

706
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:53,365
The epicenter is only 70 miles
    off the coast of Oregon

707
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,302
in what's called
 the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

Oh, Jesus, God.

...and given the proximity
       of the epicenter,

716
00:40:17,193 --> 00:40:20,095
people on the coast
  are gonna have mere minutes

00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,648
I didn't believe it at first,
            either.

845
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:19,652
But you will.

846
00:46:24,428 --> 00:46:27,726
When I was a kid,
   my dad used to say to me,

847
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:31,499
"Trust in something
        more than you."

848
00:46:33,173 --> 00:46:38,473
It's sort of become my mantra
     these past few days.

849
00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:41,773
I said it
    when I saw the visions.

850
00:46:41,808 --> 00:46:43,951
I said it when I built my weapon

851
00:46:43,986 --> 00:46:46,052
exactly the way
      it was shown to me.

852
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:47,680
I said it over and over

853
00:46:47,715 --> 00:46:51,486
as I passed every freeway exit
        on my way here.

854
00:46:53,292 --> 00:46:55,721
I said it when I walked out
      onto the boardwalk

855
00:46:55,756 --> 00:46:58,031
and I saw the others.

856
00:46:58,825 --> 00:47:02,596
We were all wearing the same
 colors we saw in our visions.

857
00:47:02,631 --> 00:47:05,599
That's when I knew
        I wasn't alone.

858
00:47:07,735 --> 00:47:10,076
(voice breaking):
       And all of this...

859
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:14,839
...is real.

860
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:19,745
And I'm saying it
       to you now, Eric,

861
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,516
you need to trust something
        more than you.

862
00:47:21,551 --> 00:47:26,059
You may not want to believe it,
but we're all on the same side.

863
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:30,965
I'm on my family's side.

864
00:47:35,037 --> 00:47:36,498
(door creaks open)

865
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:44,539

(whispering):
             Eric?

869
00:48:09,335 --> 00:48:11,467
You really okay?

870
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:15,768
My head's still ringing,
   but my vision is clearer.

871
00:48:17,178 --> 00:48:18,639
(Andrew breathes deeply)

872
00:48:24,878 --> 00:48:26,383
You know that first
      earthquake happened

873
00:48:26,418 --> 00:48:28,220
a whole four hours ago, right?

874
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:30,057
Before they showed up here.

875
00:48:30,092 --> 00:48:32,323
Leonard's checked his watch
       a thousand times.

876
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:34,688
They've been timing all of this.

877
00:48:35,493 --> 00:48:36,459
I know.

878
00:48:36,494 --> 00:48:39,132
(footsteps overhead)

879
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,566

882
00:48:50,376 --> 00:48:51,771
No.

No, it's just...

With your head and all,

885
00:48:57,845 --> 00:48:59,416
I want to make sure
   you're thinking straight.

       to manipulate us.

   how the shadow government

1012
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:52,092
was stalking them
 and using mind control weapons

1013
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:54,732
in an attempt to destroy
          their lives.

1014
00:55:55,504 --> 00:55:56,965
LEONARD:
   We found each other online

1015
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,736
because we said
    we had the same visions.

1016
00:55:58,771 --> 00:56:00,606
(whispering): Remember what
   you did at Thanksgiving?

1017

   to meet on the boardwalk.

You're gonna do that if I nod.

1019

Okay, let's continue.

You have the opportunity

I don't mean to rush you,

1022
00:56:29,362 --> 00:56:33,166
but we're gonna ask for your
    decisions very fast now.

1023
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:37,401
I'm gonna be straight up.

1024

You're, like, my last hope here.

1028
00:56:48,623 --> 00:56:50,216
Adriane,

1029
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:52,592
you can walk out of here
           right now.

1030
00:56:52,627 --> 00:56:55,529
Just walk out and see,
      nothing will happen.

None of this can stop

I didn't tell you at first,

1037
00:57:08,643 --> 00:57:11,501
but I have a son.

1038
00:57:11,536 --> 00:57:13,613
I didn't want to speak
        his name, but...

     my son is gonna die.

1041

1043

with the novel X-Nine virus,

1096
01:00:58,433 --> 01:01:01,907
which is proving particularly
      fatal to children.

1097
01:01:01,942 --> 01:01:04,173
The X-Nine virus
    is highly transmittable

1098
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:06,703
amongst children
      aged ten and under.

for the safety
       of those infected.
