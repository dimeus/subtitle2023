1
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,042
What the fuck, Caleb?

2
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:10,806
Oh, wait till you see
the shot I got.

3
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:13,182
You looked like you were gonna
shit a brick out sideways.

4
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:14,940
You could have taken
my head off.

5
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,552
It wouldn't have been a clean
decapitation

6
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,976
with these blades.

7
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,013
You'd just scramble
your face up real good.

8
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:31,163
Shouldn't you go see if
Jessica is feeling any better?

9
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,093
She'll be fine.
I gave her Klonopin

10
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:36,234
so she can sleep off whatever
the fuck is wrong with her.

11
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,231
Girl is such a pain in the ass.

12
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,298
Jessica?

13
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:24,510
Hey.

14
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,978
How you feeling, cuz?

15
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,583
Since none of these other
friends of yours

16
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,660
bothered to show up,

17
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:37,898
can I take your car and escape
the hell of being stuck here

18
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,997
with your latest boyfriend?

19
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:45,899
Great chat.

20
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,735
You better wake up
in the next half hour

21
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,351
or I'm gonna be forced
to go drown

22
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:01,915
that brainless meat puppet's
sorry ass.

23
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:34,288
"The intense horror
of my nightmare came over me."

24
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,121
"I tried to draw back my arm

25
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:39,358
but the hand clung on

26
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:42,586
and a most melancholy
voice sobbed,

27
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,961
'Let me in.'"

28
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:45,299
"'Let me in!'"

29
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:48,528
"As it spoke,

30
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:50,700
I discerned, obscurely

31
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:53,164
a child's face
looking through the window."

32
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,800
"Finding it useless to attempt

33
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,642
shaking the creature off,

34
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:01,274
I pulled its wrist on to
the broken pane..."

35
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,978
Jess?

36
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,252
- "...and rubbed it to and fro..."
- Please shut up.

37
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:06,712
"...till the blood ran down

38
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,751
and soaked the bedclothes."

39
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:11,957
"Yet still it wailed,
'Let me in!'"

40
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,426
Jessica!

41
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:38,918
Shit, shit, shit!

42
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:40,349
Shit, shit, shit!

43
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,690
No, Jess. Jess? Jess?

44
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:07,913
Who's the brainless
meat puppet now?

45
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,458
Caleb.

46
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,827
What the fuck?

47
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:25,998
Oh, my God.

48
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:27,324
What the hell happened?

49
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:31,971
Jess?

50
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:36,404
Jessica?

51
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:50,253
What the fuck? What?

52
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,151
No, no, no...

53
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:54,351
Caleb!

54
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,394
No...

55
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:02,231
No, Caleb!

56
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Caleb!

57
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Beth!

58
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,500
Beth, you in there?

59
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:17,804
Just give me five, all right?

60
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,476
Brandon is losing his shit.

61
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:20,976
He can't find the St rat he won

62
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:23,616
in that arm wrestling contest
last night.

63
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:25,585
It's already tuned and racked
stage left

64
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,148
like I told you it was
half an hour ago.

65
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,283
You feeling all right in there?

66
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:33,951
I'm fine.

67
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,220
Just go man your station.

68
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,526
I'll be back before curtains up.

69
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:39,861
You got it, boss.

70
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:49,560
Have you seen my favorite
black t-shirt?

71
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,532
I need it for the Labor Day
protest tomorrow.

72
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,434
Mom?

73
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,102
You're not going to any
protest on your own.

74
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,778
Sophie's dad's taking us.

75
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:02,225
I've told you, like,
ten times already.

76
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:03,849
Remember?

77
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:06,024
Well, did you remember
to check the bathroom hamper?

78
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,051
Tell Danny
to turn the music down.

79
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:12,888
Mom says,
"Turn the music down!"

80
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:14,590
I could've done that myself!

81
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,441
Kassie, you better not have
my scissors.

82
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,046
Don't got 'em, Mom!

83
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,518
It's dirty.

84
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,067
Well, stick it in the laundry,
and I'll do it later.

85
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:48,924
You'll forget.
You always forget.

86
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,461
You know where
the washing machine is.

87
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:00,169
Hey, Bridget.
Mom's on nights

88
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:02,264
and we're watching
all the Freddy movies in a row.

89
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:05,140
- Even the shitty ones.
- There aren't any shitty ones.

90
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,642
So, you, um,
wanna come over and...

91
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,178
In your dreams.

92
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,429
Your boyfriends are weirdos.

93
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:26,762
You're the weirdo.

94
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,434
Kassie!

95
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,749
Big crowd in tonight, Dan?

96
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:52,887
- Get out, Bridge!
- I would, but...

97
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:54,651
Let me in!

98
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:08,071
Somebody get that, please!

99
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:12,509
All right, all right!

100
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,159
Boo!

101
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:34,060
Beth.

102
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:36,194
You bitch.

103
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,595
Surprise, sis.

104
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:41,300
When did you get into town?

105
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:44,470
I Uber'd straight here from LAX.

106
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,144
Hmm.

107
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,144
You been sleeping?
You look like Mom.

108
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,317
Beats looking like a tampon.

109
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,121
You know, the downstairs
buzzer is totally busted.

110
00:11:58,257 --> 00:12:00,117
I was able to walk in
right off the street.

111
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,551
Whole building's busted.

112
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,494
It's getting knocked in a month.

113
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:04,956
You're kidding me.

114
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,589
Nope. We're out.

115
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,659
Have you guys found a new place?

116
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:11,563
Not yet.

117
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,731
Shit, El. You and Jay
have been here forever.

118
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,569
Was Bangkok awesome?

119
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,611
Insane. Crazy, obsessive fans
over there.

120
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:21,945
Did you drink snake blood?

121
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:23,980
Hey,
that's culturally insensitive.

122
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:25,642
What about
monkey brain barbecue?

123
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,716
Oh, yeah.
That's so much better, Dan.

124
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:28,948
Who's your friend, Kass?

125
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:30,554
She's called Staffanie.

126
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,426
Oh. Hey, Staffanie.

127
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:35,490
What's her, uh, situation?

128
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:39,295
Danny told me that when this
building used to be a bank,

129
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,693
a teller got caught stealing
and hunged himself

130
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,647
and if you walk around
with coins in your pockets,

131
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:45,830
his ghost hears the jingle.

132
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,534
And he scares you to death
so he can take all your money.

133
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:51,378
It's true.

134
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:53,108
If he comes after me,

135
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:55,541
Staffanie will scare him
to death first.

136
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:58,179
Ghosts aren't real.

137
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:00,050
- Have you ever seen one?
- Mmm-mmm.

138
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:02,145
Then how do you know
they don't exist?

139
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,051
Because...

140
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:07,324
I only believe what I can see.

141
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,953
For me?

142
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:13,128
It's for badass
rock chicks only.

143
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:16,861
Look, Mom. I'm a badass.

144
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,702
Please don't indoctrinate her
into your groupie world.

145
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:21,005
What's a groupie?

146
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,667
Your mom's favorite
nickname for me,

147
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,311
even though she knows
I'm a guitar technician.

148
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:26,669
If you say so.

149
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,272
Hey, be nice
or you don't get a gift.

150
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:31,375
Speaking of which,

151
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,645
check out what I got your dad.

152
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,755
What's going on, El?

153
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,397
Danny, go take my car and get
pizza with your sisters.

154
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,663
Sure thing, Mom.

155
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,502
I just can't wrap my head
around all this.

156
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,439
What, did he meet someone else?

157
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:01,878
No. He believes paying
child support

158
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:03,743
equals co-parenting from afar.

159
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:09,712
Why didn't you tell me, El?

160
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,624
I would've jumped
right on a plane

161
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,421
to help you work through this.

162
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:17,326
I called you.

163
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,263
Twice.

164
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:22,097
First time, when he told me
he was leaving.

165
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:23,728
Second, the night he moved out.

166
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,908
That was two and half
months ago, Beth.

167
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,084
I'm sorry, okay?

168
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,220
You know when I'm on the road,
I get sucked in deep

169
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:41,900
and I'm trying to make
chief tech right now.

170
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,324
And if I do,
I'll be the first woman

171
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:44,848
in my crew to do it, so...

172
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:50,623
Please, Ellie, we need
to talk this through properly.

173
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:53,791
El...

174
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,063
Look, you can sleep
on the sofa tonight

175
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,831
but I gotta pack and move.

176
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:30,493
<i>Hey, Be thy-boo.</i>

177
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,236
<i>It's Ellie. Just...</i>

178
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:35,734
<i>calling to say hi. And, um...</i>

179
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:38,506
<i>me and Jay, we, uh...</i>

180
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:42,746
<i>You know what...</i>

181
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:44,784
I don't blame you.

182
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,582
I hate the sound
of my voice too.

183
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,396
What's going on with you, Beth?

184
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,897
I screwed up again,
like I always do.

185
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:11,407
And I need you to help me
figure it out.

186
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,271
Again.

187
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:15,209
What happened?

188
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:18,150
Mmm.

189
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:28,551
Hurry up, Bridge.

190
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:30,125
You wanna carry them?

191
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,340
You wanna get your license?

192
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,892
Come on, Kass.

193
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,708
Earthquake!

194
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,382
Come on.

195
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Go!

196
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:08,398
Stay down!

197
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,408
Shit.

198
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,278
That was intense.

199
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,121
I think I peed my pants.

200
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,682
Is it warm?

201
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:33,791
Mmm-mmm.

202
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,194
It's probably just soda.

203
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:37,559
All right. Come on.

204
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:56,413
Holy shit.
Bridget, check this out.

205
00:17:57,278 --> 00:17:58,349
What is it?

206
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,610
There's a hole.

207
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:12,660
Careful, Dan.
There could be aftershocks.

208
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:25,409
It's an old bank vault!

209
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:29,809
Danny, don't!

210
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,373
Dan?

211
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:10,922
Come on, Danny. Let's go!

212
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:12,324
Just hang on!

213
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:51,390
Danny!

214
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:52,925
Relax a minute, Bridge!

215
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:14,445
Danny, are you okay?

216
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,645
I'm fine.

217
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:25,983
Anything?

218
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,450
The network is totally screwed.

219
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:30,154
I'm sure they're fine, El.

220
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:36,334
Hey.

221
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,800
Is everyone okay?
Anybody hurt?

222
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:41,273
Hey, Gabe.
The kids went to go get pizza

223
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:42,717
and I can't get through
on their cells.

224
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:43,947
Can I borrow your car
to go find them?

225
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,504
- How about I drive you?
- Thanks.

226
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,940
Let me get the keys.

227
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:57,489
- Who are you?
- Beth.

228
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,851
Ellie's sister.

229
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,022
Ah, yeah, yeah.
The groupie.

230
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:05,858
Let me ask you somethin'.

231
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:08,757
Can you hear her up there?

232
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:11,433
- What?
- Quake.

233
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:13,032
Sent her hiding in the ducts.

234
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:17,674
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

235
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:21,046
Let's roll.

236
00:22:23,414 --> 00:22:25,681
Is that them?

237
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:27,882
Good to meet you.

238
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:34,059
You never take the elevator
after a quake.

239
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:37,189
Bridget dropped the pizza.

240
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:40,763
Oh, honey. I love you guys
so much more than pizza.

241
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,840
<i>The magnitude 5.5 earthquake</i>

242
00:22:51,976 --> 00:22:53,771
<i>hit just north
of the Puente Hills fault</i>

243
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,071
<i>less than an hour ago.</i>

244
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:56,712
<i>Jolting downtown Los Angeles</i>

245
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:58,511
<i>and everywhere from
La Habra to...</i>

246
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:24,774
You think it might
be worth something?

247
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:26,669
Mom could do with some extra
money right now,

248
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,307
don't you think?

249
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:30,389
I don't think Mom wants cash
from something you stole.

250
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:32,145
It's not stolen.

251
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,160
It's probably been
locked in that vault forever.

252
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:37,050
Yeah, and weird shit like this
gets locked away for a reason.

253
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,419
Just leave it, Dan.

254
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:46,994
Argh! Fuck!

255
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,331
Let me see it.

256
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:50,466
It's just a nick.

257
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:00,474
Dan...

258
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:27,801
Danny, please close it.

259
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,392
I don't like this, Dan.

260
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,027
You need to put it back
right now.

261
00:24:49,162 --> 00:24:51,892
Mom's not letting any of us
out the front door again tonight.

262
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:53,308
First thing in the morning then.

263
00:24:54,365 --> 00:24:55,365
Promise me?

264
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:11,714
You going deep sea diving?

265
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,379
I gotta see under
before I get in.

266
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:17,256
I got stung by a jellyfish
at the beach before.

267
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:20,019
I don't like going underwater.

268
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:22,018
I don't think there's any weird

269
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,728
sea creatures in the tub.

270
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:36,398
Oh, my God!

271
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,971
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

272
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:40,603
It's a... It's a...

273
00:25:55,195 --> 00:25:56,222
You okay?

274
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,521
I'm good, sweetie.

275
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:04,604
I hate when my tummy hurts too.

276
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:03,187

You all right?

318
00:33:25,842 --> 00:33:27,572
Yeah.

319
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:29,444
Looks like it's just us

What's up, sis?

327
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:18,256
I had the most beautiful dream.

328
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,327
We were together,
sitting in a tall forest.

329
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:26,758
The wind was clean

330
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:28,761
and the birds were singing
the sweetest...

331
00:35:37,205 --> 00:35:38,474
Melodies.

332
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:43,413
It was a perfect day
and all I could think about

333
00:35:43,548 --> 00:35:45,917
was how much I wanted
to cut you all open

334
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:47,582
and climb inside your bodies

335
00:35:47,717 --> 00:35:50,046
so that we could stay
one happy family.

336
00:36:13,945 --> 00:36:14,945
It's in me.

337
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,914
Don't let it take my babies.

338
00:36:58,285 --> 00:36:59,881
Mom!

339
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,293
Bridget, take her back inside.

340
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,593
Now!

341
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,697
What's wrong with her, Bridge?

342
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:21,874
Stairs. Go!
Go, go, go.

343
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:26,910
Come on.

344
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,752
Wake up, Ellie.
Come on, wake up.

345
00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:30,150
Danny!

346
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:31,620
They're gone.

347
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,003
One minute she was fine

348
00:37:52,138 --> 00:37:54,346
and the next
she was talking crazy and...

349
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,547
And now she's gone.

350
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:22,198
Network's still fucked.

351
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:28,479
May I pray?

352
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:31,944
She's not religious.

353
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Wasn't.

354
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,390
It's just a few words.

355
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:41,057
Join me.

356
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:56,241
Eternal rest grant unto her,
O Lord

357
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,740
and let perpetual light
shine upon her.

358
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,073
May her soul

359
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,576
and the souls
of all the faithful departed

360
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:05,910
through the mercy of God...

361
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:07,452
What the hell happened
to her face?

362
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:10,719
Rest in peace.

363
00:39:12,656 --> 00:39:14,250
Looks like someone beat her up.

364
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:19,330
There's an old fire-escape
ladder

365
00:39:19,466 --> 00:39:21,495
on the north side
of the building.

366
00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:23,829
I could try to get down that,

367
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:25,894
raise the alarm,
get some help in here.

368
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,333
You have to go through 82.

369
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:28,506
Ah, shit.

370
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:30,935
That's unoccupied, right?

371
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:33,038
Yeah. Like most of this
condemned dump.

372
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,382
You got the tools?

373
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:39,350
We could just cut right
through the door.

374
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:41,276
In my truck.

375
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,760
You ain't gettin' through
those old doors

376
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:44,247
without something heavy-duty.

377
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:52,094
I want Dad to come home.

378
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:56,396
He will.

379
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:00,545
When we get the phones working
again, he'll come right back.

380
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:01,935
How do you know he will?

381
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:05,838
You said Mom was gonna be okay.

382
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:07,902
I thought she would be.

383
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,009
I'm so sorry, Kass.

384
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:16,188
I'm gonna get my shotgun,
and we're gonna blast it open.

385
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:17,753
Just give me a minute, okay?

386
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:20,124
I don't like being trapped.

387
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,458
Everyone is on edge enough

388
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,286
without guns getting fired
in here.

389
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:05,332
I don't know what to do, El.

390
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:08,540
You're the one
who always has the answers.

391
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:15,943
I'm too scared to even face
your kids right now.

392
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:29,227
No matter how busy you ever got,

393
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:31,387
you always found time for me.

394
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:34,126
For everyone.

395
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:41,166
I can't believe I'm never
gonna speak to you again.

396
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:46,501
<i>Hey, Be thy-boo. It's Ellie.</i>

397
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:50,674
<i>Just... calling to say hi.
And, uh...</i>

398
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:51,809
<i>Beth.</i>

399
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,377
<i>Beth!</i>

400
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,710
<i>You have to help me, Beth.
You have to.</i>

401
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:58,386
<i>- I'm burning.
- I'm burning alive!</i>

402
00:42:23,907 --> 00:42:24,913
El?

403
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:36,628
- Mom?
- She's alive?

404
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:39,092
She's burning up.

405
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:50,999
I'll get ice.

406
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:04,611
Mom?

407
00:44:06,117 --> 00:44:08,181
Mommy's with the maggots now.

408
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,880
Mom, stop it!

409
00:45:15,555 --> 00:45:17,452
Stop it!

410
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:23,993
It's not my fault, Bridget.

411
00:45:26,533 --> 00:45:28,765
Get away from her, Bridge!

412
00:45:28,901 --> 00:45:31,434
What's happening to me,
sweetheart?

413
00:45:31,569 --> 00:45:32,628
I don't know, Mom.

414
00:45:35,406 --> 00:45:36,533
I do.

415
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:44,277
I'm free now.

416
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:49,084
Free from all you
titty-sucking parasites.

417
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:18,711
Let me kiss it better.

418
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:46,845
Who wants to rot next?

419
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:50,277
Eeny...

420
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,514
meeny...

421
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,854
miny...

422
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,490
You.

423
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:03,559
Ellie?

424
00:47:21,347 --> 00:47:22,347
Fuck!

425
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,421
Grab the cabinet.

426
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:20,829
Get away from the door.

427
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:05,306
Please, we need help!

428
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:07,144
Let me in!

429
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,532
Hello!

430
00:50:02,036 --> 00:50:04,141
Can you hear me?

431
00:50:15,084 --> 00:50:17,964
Don't you think Mom looks just like
one of those pictures from that book?

432
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,017
Answer me, Danny.

433
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:31,096
You never should've stolen it.

434
00:50:31,232 --> 00:50:32,460
This isn't my fault.

435
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,270
This is your fault!

436
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:36,765
- Get off me! Get off!
- Stop it!

437
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:38,901
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- This is all your fault!

438
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:40,672
Hey. Hey.

439
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:45,281
You don't turn on each other.

440
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:48,911
Ever.

441
00:50:50,517 --> 00:50:52,519
I need to show you something.

442
00:51:11,074 --> 00:51:12,473
What is this, Danny?

443
00:51:21,888 --> 00:51:23,154
Does it hurt bad?

444
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,488
Bridget?

445
00:51:30,993 --> 00:51:32,196
I'm okay.

I took these too.

457
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,708
There's this creepy priest
on them,

458
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,083
reading passages from the book.

Hey there, cutie-pie.

470
00:54:19,098 --> 00:54:21,255
What's wrong with you, Mom?

471
00:54:23,436 --> 00:54:27,838
I was just feeling sad about
me and your dad.

472
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,202
But he's here now.

473
00:54:29,338 --> 00:54:31,305
He came home to see us.

474
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,135
We're getting back together.

475
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,171
We love each other.

476
00:54:38,283 --> 00:54:39,977
Isn't that right, my darling?

477
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,091
And we love you too.

478
00:55:19,148 --> 00:55:21,425
Open up and let us in, Kassie.

479
00:55:23,627 --> 00:55:26,188
We can be a big,
happy family again.

480
00:55:28,299 --> 00:55:30,258
You don't look so good, Mom.

481
00:55:32,068 --> 00:55:33,603
Oh.

482
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:37,771
Nothing a big old hug and kiss
from you won't fix.

483
00:55:39,373 --> 00:55:40,675
Open up now,

484
00:55:41,376 --> 00:55:43,040
like a good girl.

485
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,049
That's it.

486
00:55:53,223 --> 00:55:54,491
Come on, now.

487
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,496
Do it for Mom and Dad.

488
00:56:13,672 --> 00:56:14,709
Mom!

489
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,825
- You okay?
- I'm sorry.

490
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,394
I thought Mom was better.

491
00:56:37,398 --> 00:56:39,069
Open the door
like you open your legs,

492
00:56:39,205 --> 00:56:40,603
you stinking groupie slut!

493
00:56:44,103 --> 00:56:48,512
I'm not a groupie,
you psycho bitch!

494
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,914
Beth.

495
00:56:58,088 --> 00:56:59,088
Beth.

496
00:57:02,084 --> 00:57:03,494
Go to your room.

497
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,942
It'll be okay, Danny.

498
00:57:27,113 --> 00:57:29,546
Staffanie will protect us.
Right?

499
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:37,693
Yeah.

500
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:22,232
What are you looking at, hon?

501
00:58:43,092 --> 00:58:44,789
I gotta kill the creepy-crawlies

502
00:58:44,924 --> 00:58:46,927
that I got inside my tummy.

503
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:01,579
I don't like having things
inside my tummy.

504
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:10,053
Do you, Auntie Beth?

505
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,014
Hey.

506
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:23,644
Is this a nightmare?

507
01:01:26,451 --> 01:01:28,253
It's just like a nightmare,
Kass.

508
01:01:30,052 --> 01:01:33,760
Is what happened to Bridget
and Mom gonna happen to us?

509
01:01:33,896 --> 01:01:35,425
I'm not gonna let that happen.

510
01:01:36,532 --> 01:01:37,735
I promise.

511
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:43,631
You'd be a good mom someday,
Auntie Beth.

512
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,803
Oh, yeah?

513
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:48,944
Yeah.

514
01:01:50,714 --> 01:01:52,706
You know how to lie to kids.

515
01:02:21,009 --> 01:02:22,604
I thought I should tie her up.

516
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,882
Just in case.

517
01:02:29,886 --> 01:02:31,888
I wanna listen to that vinyl.

518
01:02:33,385 --> 01:02:35,925
It's too dangerous.
Those words...

519
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,695
Yeah, well, maybe
there's words on there

520
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:41,656
that can help stop all of this.

521
01:02:44,233 --> 01:02:46,364
We've got no power
to run a turntable.

522
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,104
I can fix that.

523
01:03:10,793 --> 01:03:13,787
I listened to the first and then he
spoke the words on the second.

524
01:03:17,729 --> 01:03:20,629
I guess I'll start
at the other end, then.

525
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:27,537
Just in case.

526
01:03:58,339 --> 01:03:59,733
<i>It is now two nights</i>

527
01:03:59,868 --> 01:04:02,576
<i>since I read aloud
from the book.</i>

528
01:04:02,711 --> 01:04:05,542
<i>My want to understand and
commune with the other side</i>

529
01:04:05,677 --> 01:04:08,575
<i>could not have been
more misguided.</i>

530
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,681
<i>I make this final recording</i>

531
01:04:10,817 --> 01:04:13,381
<i>as a warning to whoever next
comes into contact</i>

532
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,156
<i>with its malignant pages.</i>

533
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:20,691
Naturum Demon to
<i>cannot be destroyed.</i>

534
01:04:20,827 --> 01:04:25,027
<i>When you find it, bury it deep
in our secret vault,</i>

535
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:28,562
<i>for the words I uttered have
unleashed a demonic entity</i>

536
01:04:28,697 --> 01:04:30,435
<i>beyond my darkest nightmare.</i>

537
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:35,605
Is Bridget gonna
come back like Mom?

538
01:04:38,848 --> 01:04:40,412
I don't know, Kass.

539
01:04:43,353 --> 01:04:46,055
<i>The demon possessed
Cortez first,</i>

540
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,925
<i>rotting him from the inside out.</i>

541
01:04:55,365 --> 01:04:56,791
<i>With the might of
our Lord's words,</i>

542
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:59,295
<i>we tried to drive out
the foul entity</i>

543
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:01,268
<i>but it mocked our prayers</i>

544
01:05:01,404 --> 01:05:03,435
<i>and took Shanahan
under its control.</i>

545
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:08,937
<i>Fellow priests came to our aid</i>

546
01:05:09,073 --> 01:05:10,858
<i>but the possession quickly
spread amongst them</i>

547
01:05:10,882 --> 01:05:12,774
<i>without rhyme nor reason.</i>

548
01:05:26,926 --> 01:05:30,799
<i>This evil is not governed
by the rules of man.</i>

549
01:05:30,935 --> 01:05:33,433
<i>No, it takes its pleasure</i>

550
01:05:33,568 --> 01:05:36,798
<i>in creating terror
through total chaos.</i>

551
01:05:42,441 --> 01:05:44,840
<i>Desperate to end this curse,</i>

552
01:05:44,975 --> 01:05:48,614
<i>I tried to kill what were once
my brothers.</i>

553
01:05:48,749 --> 01:05:51,516
<i>I led them to the woodshed
and set it ablaze.</i>

554
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:54,548
<i>But they danced in its flame</i>

555
01:05:54,683 --> 01:05:56,856
<i>and reveled in its burn.</i>

556
01:06:22,253 --> 01:06:25,055
Mr. Fonda's kitty hides up
there sometimes.

557
01:06:26,957 --> 01:06:29,954
I don't think it's a cat.

558
01:06:30,089 --> 01:06:32,519
<i>I buried their
squirming, spitting corpses</i>

559
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:33,860
<i>in consecrated earth.</i>

560
01:06:35,966 --> 01:06:37,866
<i>But they arose again,</i>

561
01:06:38,001 --> 01:06:39,729
<i>rotting and rage-filled.</i>

562
01:06:47,538 --> 01:06:49,706
Careful, Danny.

563
01:07:34,988 --> 01:07:37,556
<i>After hiding
in the cellar for a night,</i>

564
01:07:37,691 --> 01:07:39,756
<i>I knew only one choice remained.</i>

565
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:44,101
<i>Complete bodily dismemberment.</i>

566
01:08:04,449 --> 01:08:07,014
Told you, you should've
put the book back, Danny.

567
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:27,276
<i>I chopped, and I hacked,
and I...</i>

568
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:30,646
<i>I failed.</i>

569
01:08:33,884 --> 01:08:38,146
<i>I can hear them outside the
doors now, begging for me.</i>

570
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:42,423
<i>It is only a matter of time
before I am taken too.</i>

571
01:08:42,559 --> 01:08:46,329
<i>Nothing can stop
this demonic force.</i>

572
01:08:46,464 --> 01:08:49,199
<i>Even its final remnants
will come after you.</i>

573
01:08:50,428 --> 01:08:51,834
<i>You must run.</i>

574
01:08:51,969 --> 01:08:54,204
<i>All you can do is run!</i>

575
01:09:04,514 --> 01:09:06,543
<i>This horror will not stop</i>

576
01:09:06,678 --> 01:09:08,713
<i>until innocence is destroyed.</i>

577
01:09:10,151 --> 01:09:11,715
<i>Until evil...</i>

578
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:13,852
<i>...be thy name.</i>

579
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:36,175
Danny.

580
01:09:40,378 --> 01:09:42,542
I'm sorry, Kass.

581
01:09:50,594 --> 01:09:53,263
I will swallow your soul.

582
01:10:13,444 --> 01:10:14,911
Two souls?

583
01:10:20,287 --> 01:10:22,020
Please. El...

584
01:10:22,155 --> 01:10:25,924
Ellie waits in hell for you
and your unborn bastard baby.

585
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,060
No.

586
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:34,931
Auntie Beth!

587
01:10:57,225 --> 01:10:58,361
Are you hurt?

588
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:04,631
Are you gonna be a mom?

589
01:11:13,305 --> 01:11:14,311
Yes.

590
01:11:17,843 --> 01:11:19,712
And I'm getting us out of here.

591
01:11:21,016 --> 01:11:22,110
How?

592
01:11:55,484 --> 01:11:56,809
Fire escape. Let's go.

593
01:12:05,624 --> 01:12:08,057
Don't look back there.

594
01:13:14,628 --> 01:13:16,466
Get back. Cover your ears.

595
01:13:21,402 --> 01:13:22,402
Be thy-boo!

596
01:13:39,283 --> 01:13:40,455
She's trying to take

597
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,316
your mommy away
from you, Kassie.

598
01:13:44,395 --> 01:13:46,419
I know you're not my mom
anymore.

599
01:13:52,698 --> 01:13:54,130
Don't take me from them.

600
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,497
You have no idea what it's like

601
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,004
to bring a child into
this world, Beth.

602
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:08,848
That's my gun,
you thieving cunt.

603
01:14:15,457 --> 01:14:16,457
Auntie Beth!

604
01:14:17,127 --> 01:14:18,352
Auntie Beth!

605
01:14:40,413 --> 01:14:43,619
Everybody here
dies by dawn, Beth.

606
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,389
Run!

607
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:47,887
Dead by dawn!

608
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,989
Dead by dawn!

609
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,695
- Dead by dawn!
- By dawn!

610
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,863
Dead by dawn!

611
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,727
Dead by dawn!

612
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:02,103
Dead by dawn!

613
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:03,335
Dead by dawn!

614
01:15:05,143 --> 01:15:07,038
Dead by dawn!

615
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,205
Dead by dawn!

616
01:15:10,577 --> 01:15:12,549
Dead by dawn!

617
01:15:17,153 --> 01:15:18,219
Here.

618
01:16:27,217 --> 01:16:29,751
No way out!

619
01:16:29,886 --> 01:16:32,490
No way out!

620
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,730
No way out!

621
01:16:45,202 --> 01:16:46,643
- Auntie Beth!
- Come here!

622
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,618
No!

623
01:18:00,383 --> 01:18:02,345
Kassie. Kassie.

624
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,087
Kassie. Kassie. Kassie.

625
01:18:13,561 --> 01:18:14,561
Am I dead?

626
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:36,412
Come on. Get in.

627
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:01,107
Kass, where's the beeper?

628
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:11,645
Come on. Come on.

629
01:19:32,574 --> 01:19:33,574
It's coming.

630
01:21:28,382 --> 01:21:29,382
Get under!

631
01:21:39,931 --> 01:21:41,333
Kassie!

632
01:22:17,298 --> 01:22:20,267
All I want
is your little head, baby girl.

633
01:22:41,566 --> 01:22:43,032
Come get some.

634
01:24:08,114 --> 01:24:09,948
Turn it on, Kass!

635
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,800
Please.

636
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:07,605
Help me, Be thy-boo.

637
01:25:09,741 --> 01:25:13,642
Only my sister
gets to call me that.

638
01:25:47,811 --> 01:25:50,010
You know, you really do
look like Mom.

639
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:56,253
And you're gonna fail
miserably just like her.

640
01:25:56,389 --> 01:25:57,822
You stinking, horrible...

641
01:25:57,957 --> 01:26:00,229
...groupie cunt!

642
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:33,213
There's been no cell signal

643
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:34,509
until, like, five minutes ago

644
01:28:34,614 --> 01:28:35,978
and the thunder kept me awake,

645
01:28:36,113 --> 01:28:38,519
so I got basically
less than zero sleep.

646
01:28:38,654 --> 01:28:41,216
Anyway, all my early morning
moans aside,

647
01:28:41,352 --> 01:28:44,787
we are still gonna have such
a fab weekend at the lake.

648
01:28:44,922 --> 01:28:46,693
Caleb's dad's cabin
is so awesome,

649
01:28:46,828 --> 01:28:49,123
and you're gonna absolutely
love his friends.

650
01:28:51,194 --> 01:28:53,327
I'm sure one of them
will be perfect for you.

651
01:28:53,463 --> 01:28:55,395
<i>I don't mean to be
a downer or anything</i>

652
01:28:55,531 --> 01:28:57,699
<i>but I was actually thinking
of taking a rain check</i>

653
01:28:57,835 --> 01:29:00,039
<i>on this whole trip thing.</i>

654
01:29:00,175 --> 01:29:01,042
Not a chance.

655
01:29:01,178 --> 01:29:02,644
I'm picking you up in 15.

656
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:03,780
Bye!
