of the Reggio Calabria bishop.

It wasn't a...

224

In English, Father Amorth.

225
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,184
(IN ENGLISH) That was not an exorcism.

226
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,938
From Father Gianni's description,
what occurred in Reggio Calabria sounded

227
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,942
exactly like an exorcism,
complete with animal sacrifice, no less.

- Do you deny this?
- No.

00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,669
- That's what I did.
- And why would you do that?

Exorcism is my job,

You are not a doctor,

for the Doctrine of the Faith

be formally vacated.

You had me worried this time.

what you have done.
