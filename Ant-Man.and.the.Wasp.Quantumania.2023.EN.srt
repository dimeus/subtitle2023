1
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,786
What is this place?

2
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:55,389
My life doesn't really make sense.

3
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:56,682
Hey.

4
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,560
I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.

5
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,897
"Scott, you're a divorced ex-con.
How are you an Avenger?

6
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,858
"Why are you time traveling
with Captain America?

7
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:07,526
"That doesn't make sense."

8
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:10,946
A lot has changed about my life.

9
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:13,657
But everywhere I go,
people ask me the same thing.

10
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:14,992
Can you take a picture with my dog?

11
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:17,536
"Scott, what about now?

12
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:18,745
"What's next?

13
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,330
"Where does the ride take you?"

14
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:23,208
If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.

15
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,376
All right.

16
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:28,964
-It's been a crazy few years. For everyone.
-Hey, hi. How are you?

17
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:30,549
Everything is ready for you.

18
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:31,717
You're too much.

19
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:33,260
No, no, no.

20
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:34,511
Your money's no good here.

21
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,097
-Are we still talking about that?
-Yes, of course.

22
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,558
Rubin, you are the best.

23
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,269
Thank you, Spider-Man.

24
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:46,982
So, let's make time for the stuff
that really matters.

25
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:48,358
Like friends.

26
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,153
Friends you didn't even know you had.

27
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:55,240
Remember the people who got you here.

28
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:56,658
You couldn't have done it without them.

29
00:03:57,576 --> 00:04:00,662
Hey, I'm just a guy who got fired
from Baskin-Robbins.

30
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:03,248
Sometimes you just get lucky.

31
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,375
I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.

32
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,919
I think you know who she is.

33
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:10,172
She's taken back her dad's company.

34
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,091
Now she's using the Pym Particle
for global change.

35
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,512
A lot of people say they want
to save the world...

36
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,471
but Hope, she saves it every day.

37
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,640
Thank you.

38
00:04:21,225 --> 00:04:22,434
Thank you so much.

39
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:26,522
Reforestation. Affordable housing.
Food production.

40
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:28,273
She's not wasting a second.

41
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,532
I still can't believe it.

42
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:39,034
None of this should have happened.

43
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:40,202
But it did.

44
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,830
It's a pretty good world.

45
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,707
I'm glad we saved it.

46
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,544
"Do I miss the action?

47
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:50,837
"Sometimes.

48
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,382
"Will I be there when the Avengers need me?

49
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:54,508
"Absolutely.

50
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:56,426
"I'd never turn my back on them.

51
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:00,430
"But right now, the only job I want
is being a dad.

52
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:03,016
"I love you, Cassie.

53
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:05,686
"Thanks for being my hero.

54
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:09,314
"And I'm sorry I missed some birthdays.

55
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:13,277
"And for the rest of you kids out there...

56
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:14,570
"word of advice.

57
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,072
"Look out for the little guy.

58
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:18,490
"Make mistakes.

59
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,701
"Take chances.

60
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,787
"Because if there's one thing
life's taught me...

61
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:27,374
"there's always room to grow."

62
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:35,299
Sorry, that's me.

63
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:38,427
Why is jail calling?

64
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,929
Lang!

65
00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:43,849
-Lang!
-I'm here.

66
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:45,434
All right, come on. Let's go.

67
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:48,520
Come on.

68
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:54,985
Hey. Is she okay? Have you heard anything?

69
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:56,153
Not yet. No.

70
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:58,572
Hi, Hope.
Hey, Dad.

71
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:00,532
Cassie. What happened?

72
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:01,700
Sign here.

73
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:04,703
You know, just jail stuff.

74
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:06,496
Give it back.

75
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:08,916
I know it was you.

76
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,083
Are you sure?

77
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,460
I mean, it was kind of hard to see...

78
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:14,504
through all that tear gas you fired
into the park full of peaceful protestors.

79
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:15,422
Where is it?

80
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:17,633
I'm sorry.
This must be really embarrassing for you.

81
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:22,804
I did find this though.

82
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:29,686
You shrank a cop car?

83
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:30,938
What were you thinking?

84
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:32,856
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

85
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:34,942
They were clearing out a homeless camp
in the middle of the night.

86
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,860
-No, I'm not saying that...
-And where do they expect them to go?

87
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:38,946
It's not their fault that they lost
their homes in the Blip.

88
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:39,947
I know that.

89
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:43,033
No one can even afford rent right now,
unless you're some trust-fund asshole.

90
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,284
I'm not telling you what to do.

91
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,744
-I'm just saying...
-Telling her what to do.

92
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,246
Telling me exactly what to do.

93
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:48,872
No, you do what you want.

94
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,666
I'm suggesting another way to do it.

95
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

96
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,460
You know, I promised your mom...

97
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:56,088
that you would only use this stuff
when one of us was around.

98
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,256
It's really dangerous tech.

99
00:06:57,422 --> 00:06:58,757
I know it's dangerous.

100
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:01,176
What if the cops took it from you?
What if you lost it?

101
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:02,344
I didn't lose the suit.

102
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:03,345
You have a suit?

103
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:04,721
Wait, you have a suit?

104
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:06,265
I know how to
take care of myself, okay?

105
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:08,308
Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.

106
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:10,519
Ouch.

107
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:14,565
-I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
-I know.

108
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:16,024
That's okay. It's all right.

109
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,276
I get it.

110
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:19,987
I just think you should get
to have a normal life.

111
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:21,947
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee...

112
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:23,991
tried to kill me in my room when I was six.

113
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:26,618
I've never had a normal life.

114
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:29,413
How about some music?

115
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:32,082
"And in that moment, all I could think was...

116
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,543
"'How did the Hulk turn me into a baby?

117
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,545
"'Will I be a baby forever?

118
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:37,963
"'Am I the Hulk's baby?'"

119
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,840
Dad, are you listening to your own book?

120
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:42,384
-"But I was ready for anything.
-Hmm? No, that's...

121
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,094
-It's just the radio.
-"Steve and I grew close over that."

122
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:45,762
-Dad, turn it off.
-It's so weird.

123
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:47,764
Something's wrong with this switch.
It won't turn off.

124
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:48,974
I said turn it off.

125
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:50,350
What's that? Turn it up? All right.

126
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:53,103
"A little after that,
a raccoon from space showed up.

127
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,897
"I don't think he knew my name.

128
00:07:55,063 --> 00:07:57,399
"I was just happy to meet a raccoon
who could talk."

129
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:02,112
Excuse me.

130
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,363
Thank you.

131
00:08:05,157 --> 00:08:06,241
All right.

132
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:09,411
Your Nobel Prize is in the mail.

133
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:12,122
It better be. I just saved eight bucks.

134
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:14,249
God, I admire you.

135
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,626
Thank you.

136
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,420
I missed this.

137
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:20,339
No pizza in the Quantum Realm?

138
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:23,425
No. No anything.

139
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:25,844
You know, Mom, you can talk about it.

140
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:27,387
If you want.

141
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,557
Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.

142
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:34,144
I wanna live right now.

143
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:41,400
So, Cassie, did you make any new friends
in the slammer this time?

144
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:42,653
Grandpa.

145
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,112
"This time"?

146
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:45,739
Was there a last time?

147
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:47,824
I mean, last time barely counts.

148
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:49,952
I didn't know that.

149
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:50,994
Why didn't you call me?

150
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:52,412
'Cause I knew you'd be like this.

151
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,414
I would've just broken you out with ants.

152
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:55,916
All right, you know what? Family meeting.

153
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,084
Can we have a family meeting?

154
00:08:57,251 --> 00:08:58,252
Isn't that what we're doing?

155
00:08:58,418 --> 00:08:59,378
Yeah, I mean about this.

156
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:01,421
About everybody being so fine with this.

157
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:05,425
Look, you wanna help. I get it.

158
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:07,094
I do, Cassie. I really do.

159
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,512
But I don't want you wasting your life.

160
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,806
At least I'm still trying to
do something with mine.

161
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:15,018
I literally saved the world.

162
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:16,019
Oh, did you?

163
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:17,896
Well, yeah, you never mentioned
that before.

164
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:19,690
Hey, everybody, Scott saved the world.

165
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,024
How was that for you, Scott?

166
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:22,484
You should write a book about it.

167
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,069
Ha ha. Hilarious.

168
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:26,113
Yeah, you're welcome for all not being dust.

169
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,739
And what do you do now?

170
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:30,909
Sign books?

171
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:33,912
Aren't you the guy who broke into VistaCorp?

172
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:35,789
Aren't you the guy who flew all the way
to Germany...

173
00:09:35,956 --> 00:09:37,916
just to fight Captain America at the airport?

174
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,252
Fight with Captain America at the airport.

175
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:43,005
Wouldn't fight Captain America.

176
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:44,173
Not insane.

177
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,466
People still need help, Dad.

178
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:50,262
At least we're trying to do something
that matters.

179
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:54,808
Who's "we"?

180
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:58,103
What are you three up to?

181
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:00,022
Science.

182
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:03,400
With ants.

183
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:05,569
Ant science.

184
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:08,113
I don't believe you.

185
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,325
Let's just show him.

186
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:16,830
What are they building?

187
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:18,123
Are you doing this?

188
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,501
Actually, no, they built their own tech.

189
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,128
Pretty smart ants.

190
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,047
Okay, so when you were all...

191
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:28,217
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

192
00:10:28,383 --> 00:10:30,677
And I started reading Grandpa Hank's
old journals...

193
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:32,804
and I got really into the Quantum Realm
and...

194
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,681
The Quantum Realm?

195
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,185
I know we all have a history there,
and I didn't want to freak anyone out...

196
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:39,269
but we've been talking about it.

197
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:40,854
She had some questions, okay?

198
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:44,191
I can't help if people are inspired by me.

199
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:49,363
So, you've been studying the Quantum Realm?

200
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:52,282
Why didn't you ask me about it?

201
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,535
I tried, Mom.

202
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:55,827
A lot.

203
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,663
You never wanted to talk about it.

204
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,081
Cassie's just been curious...

205
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,916
and we gave her some pointers.

206
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,711
This isn't exactly ant science, is it, Henry?

207
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:07,881
You know how dangerous the Quantum Realm is.

208
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:08,882
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

209
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:10,592
Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.

210
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,594
That's why we made this.

211
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,139
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

212
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:20,227
But Quantum.

213
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:23,856
We just need a map.

214
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:27,442
And then we can study and explore
the entire Quantum Realm.

215
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:30,362
Never even have to go.

216
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:35,409
Your daughter built a subatomic
Hubble Telescope in a basement.

217
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,873
You know, if I had something like this
when you were gone...

218
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,210
then I could have found you.

219
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:49,715
It's amazing.

220
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:51,967
I'm blown away.

221
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:55,679
How does it work?

222
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:58,807
It's kinda like that two-way radio
we used to have.

223
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:00,893
You send a signal down from here...

224
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,020
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

225
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:04,146
Wait. Wait a minute.

226
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:08,108
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

227
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:10,819
Yeah.

228
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:13,197
-Shut it down now.
-Janet...

229
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:15,073
-Why would we shut it...
-What's wrong?

230
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,325
You have to turn it off!

231
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:18,035
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

232
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,789
Janet?

233
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:28,503
There's something I should have told...

234
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:03,705
Dad?

235
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,584
No!

236
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,253
-No!
-Mom!

237
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:11,171
No!

238
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:13,549
Damn it!

239
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:16,635
Dad?

240
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,960
Dad!

241
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:56,717
Dad!

242
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:22,910
Cassie.

243
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:29,458
Dad!

244
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,335
Oh, Dad. Come on.

245
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:33,545
Okay.

246
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:34,546
Are you okay?

247
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:35,839
Yeah. I'm okay.

248
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:53,315
Where are we?

249
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,417
Mom!

250
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:15,045
Dad!

251
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:16,922
Hope. Over here.

252
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:20,592
Are you okay?

253
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:23,011
We should be dead.

254
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,013
Why aren't we?

255
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,390
I don't know.

256
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:29,935
Are we where I think we are?

257
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:32,312
I would say yes...

258
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:34,815
but it wasn't like this.

259
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:36,191
Janet!

260
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:37,609
Mom!

261
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:39,736
Janet!

262
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:42,406
Mom!

263
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,628
Do not move.

264
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:16,690
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

265
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,901
Right now.

266
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:24,865
Hope? Hope?

267
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:26,950
Hank? Can you hear me?

268
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:30,537
-Can anyone hear me?
-Oh, my God.

269
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,081
-It's okay.
-What are we gonna do?

270
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:35,042
It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

271
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:36,251
We're okay. It's gonna be okay.

272
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:37,502
You're saying "okay" too much.

273
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:39,838
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

274
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:40,881
We're okay.

275
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:42,049
We are fine.

276
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:44,593
Hey, we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna go home.

277
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:46,845
In the meantime, look around.

278
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:48,222
It's beautiful.

279
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:49,640
All right? We're outside.

280
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:52,518
It's like we're camping. We love camping.

281
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:53,852
We've never been camping.

282
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:56,688
But we've always talked about it.

283
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:03,237
Is that sun moving?

284
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:15,207
Get back!

285
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:20,837
Oh, my God.

286
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,422
I don't think this is a sun!

287
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:25,258
It's fine.

288
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:27,469
-Dad!
-Honey, it's okay.

289
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:28,637
Still okay.

290
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:38,939
Dad. Oh, my God.

291
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:40,107
That was weird.

292
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:46,488
Run.

293
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:18,395
There's Quantum people in the Quantum Realm?

294
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:19,563
Yeah.

295
00:18:20,397 --> 00:18:21,815
I didn't know that either.

296
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:27,321
What was that back there, Mom?

297
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:29,114
What was that ship looking for?

298
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:30,991
Keep your voice down.

299
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:33,243
You said there was nothing down here.

300
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,745
Why didn't you tell us about all of this?

301
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:36,538
Hope, I will explain everything,
but right now...

302
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:38,540
-I just need you to trust me.
-Then make me trust you!

303
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:41,251
Let's just calm down, all right?
We can talk about this...

304
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,503
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

305
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,880
No, you need to tell us what's...

306
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:47,424
Why didn't you listen?
I told you to stay away from here.

307
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:50,344
Janet, I'm so sorry.

308
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:53,805
I should have told you what we were doing.
I had no idea...

309
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:54,973
I know. It's...

310
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:57,309
We'll talk later.

311
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:59,269
Right now, we stick together...

312
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:01,605
we find Scott and Cassie...

313
00:19:02,356 --> 00:19:03,857
and we go home. Okay?

314
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:05,359
-Okay?
-Okay?

315
00:19:05,526 --> 00:19:06,527
-Okay.
-Okay.

316
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:07,694
Stay close.

317
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:16,453
This is incredible.

318
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:19,456
I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.

319
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,001
Why didn't I see any of this?

320
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:25,546
You weren't able to look deep enough.

321
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:28,173
Not through the Void and Subatomica.

322
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:31,260
There are worlds here...

323
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:33,136
worlds within worlds.

324
00:19:34,388 --> 00:19:37,891
It's a place outside time and space.

325
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:41,854
It's a secret universe...

326
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:43,814
beneath ours.

327
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:06,879
Hey, get your hands off me!

328
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:14,845
Cassie?

329
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:18,640
Where's my daughter?

330
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:21,810
Where is she?

331
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:23,896
Cassie?

332
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:28,859
Where's my daughter?

333
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:33,488
Cassie!

334
00:20:36,158 --> 00:20:37,159
Dad!

335
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:38,994
Cassie!

336
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:41,121
Drink the ooze.

337
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:43,540
What?

338
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:06,855
I'll handle this.

339
00:21:21,203 --> 00:21:22,120
Mom.

340
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:18,135
Was that a good stab?

341
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:20,053
I got us a ride.

342
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:40,407
He's friendly.

343
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:42,409
Quite a ride.

344
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:45,495
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

345
00:22:45,662 --> 00:22:46,580
I like ants.

346
00:22:46,747 --> 00:22:49,041
And I love that you love them. Here.

347
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,085
These will help us blend in.

348
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:55,756
Where exactly are we going on this?

349
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:57,674
We're not too far from an old friend of mine.

350
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:59,718
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are...

351
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:01,803
it'll be him.

352
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:03,680
After you.

353
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:06,808
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

354
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:14,274
Let me go! Let me go!

355
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:26,954
I don't know what you're saying!

356
00:23:27,746 --> 00:23:28,956
I don't know what you...

357
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:48,851
No! No!

358
00:23:58,443 --> 00:24:00,070
Drink the ooze!

359
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:01,572
Drink the ooze!

360
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:03,615
Drink the ooze!

361
00:24:03,782 --> 00:24:05,117
Drink the ooze!

362
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:07,786
Hello.

363
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:08,871
Hi. Hi.

364
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:10,455
Did you drink the ooze?

365
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:13,417
Why can I understand you?

366
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:14,668
Great. That's the ooze.

367
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:16,712
Hey, everybody, it worked! Ooze worked!

368
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:21,842
We can finally be friends.

369
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:23,177
Hi. I am Veb.

370
00:24:23,343 --> 00:24:24,303
You just drank me.

371
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:25,679
I did... What?

372
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:26,972
Do you need some more ooze? Here.

373
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:29,057
-I can pour some ooze into your hole...
-No, I'm okay.

374
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:30,767
-I'm okay. I'm okay.
-Oh, wow!

375
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:32,352
A big hole.

376
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,188
How many holes do you have?

377
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:36,190
I'm sorry. Is that a personal question?

378
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:37,941
I don't have any holes.

379
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:40,152
His name is Scott Lang.

380
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:42,571
He has seven holes.

381
00:24:47,492 --> 00:24:48,577
Yeah, that's right.

382
00:24:48,744 --> 00:24:50,495
How did you know that?

383
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:52,664
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

384
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,043
You can read minds?

385
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,296
Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.

386
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:02,466
Everyone is disgusting.

387
00:25:04,343 --> 00:25:06,303
-Could you please stop thinking that?
-Sorry.

388
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:08,680
-Please, stop.
-Thinking?

389
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:11,183
-Thinking that.
-I'm trying.

390
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,561
Well, not very hard.
And I think you look weird too.

391
00:25:14,728 --> 00:25:16,230
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

392
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:17,648
I wish my head glowed.

393
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:19,733
No, no, you don't.

394
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,319
I know I don't. I'm nervous, okay?
And it just came out.

395
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:23,362
What are you doing here?

396
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,447
-Are you a spy?
-What? No. No, no.

397
00:25:25,614 --> 00:25:26,573
We should torture him.

398
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,658
Guys. No, it's okay.

399
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:30,536
We're not spies. He's my dad.

400
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,081
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

401
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:38,210
Then who is San Francisco?

402
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:39,920
-It's where we're from.
-It's a place.

403
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:41,046
Then what's Earth?

404
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:42,047
It's also where we're from.

405
00:25:42,214 --> 00:25:43,215
We should torture them.

406
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:45,509
Why are you always trying to torture people?
We have other options.

407
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:48,470
Do things come out of your holes,
like milk, juice...

408
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:51,098
Veb, stop asking about his holes.

409
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:52,307
Some of us have holes.

410
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:53,892
What are you doing here?

411
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,727
Where are you from?

412
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:57,688
-Okay.
-Up there. Up there.

413
00:25:57,855 --> 00:26:00,816
-See, above this, it's a different universe.
-The Earth. Big Earth.

414
00:26:00,983 --> 00:26:03,068
-It's the same universe, but it's bigger.
-This is Earth, but it's a very small Earth.

415
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:05,070
-Sometimes, I guess.
-I get big. I shrink.

416
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:07,114
-And it's like...
-But I wrote a book about it, actually.

417
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,156
-I don't know.
-This is the Quantum Realm.

418
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:09,533
You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.

419
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,493
-We shrunk. Right now, we're really small.
-It's bigger where we're from.

420
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,453
-So, we're small right now.
-It's bigger.

421
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:19,251
Okay, they're telling the truth.

422
00:26:19,418 --> 00:26:20,294
It doesn't matter.

423
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:24,923
You come from above.

424
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:27,176
Like him.

425
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:31,305
So, he is hunting you.

426
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:34,600
He will burn the world to find you.

427
00:26:35,517 --> 00:26:36,518
Who?

428
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:39,438
The Conqueror.

429
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:45,921
There are beings down here.
Intelligent beings.

430
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:49,049
I always theorized it was possible,
but to be here...

431
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:52,302
a subatomic universe.

432
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:54,930
This changes everything we know about life...

433
00:27:55,097 --> 00:27:57,516
evolution, our place in the galaxy...

434
00:27:57,683 --> 00:27:59,393
Holy shit!

435
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:01,436
That guy looks like broccoli.

436
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:12,155
Keep your head down.

437
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,292
Follow me.

438
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:19,723
Drink those.

439
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:21,767
I'll be right back.

440
00:29:36,323 --> 00:29:37,407
I'm here for Krylar.

441
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:43,372
It's you.

442
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:44,873
Let's keep that between us.

443
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:47,501
And Krylar.

444
00:29:47,668 --> 00:29:48,669
Hello.

445
00:29:49,878 --> 00:29:51,630
I don't know your ways or customs...

446
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:55,342
but I assume that you have a beverage
that can get me drunk?

447
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:56,552
Absolutely, sir.

448
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:01,932
So, what's your story then?

449
00:30:03,392 --> 00:30:04,393
God.

450
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:06,937
Move.

451
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:08,355
It's time.

452
00:30:08,897 --> 00:30:09,898
Follow me.

453
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:17,865
Right this way.

454
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:25,873
How exactly do you know this guy?

455
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,209
Old freedom fighter friend of mine.

456
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,378
Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?

457
00:30:31,545 --> 00:30:32,588
Or terrorist.

458
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:34,798
Depends on who you ask.

459
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:38,343
But, trust me, he can help.

460
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,971
Janet Van Dyne?

461
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:26,517
I thought you were dead.

462
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:29,019
Been a long time, Krylar.

463
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:32,439
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

464
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:34,942
I fought like hell against that.

465
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:37,110
It sounds so elitist.

466
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:41,031
You have got to be Hank.

467
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,952
I've heard so much about you and your ants.

468
00:31:45,118 --> 00:31:47,287
What are ants anyway?

469
00:31:47,454 --> 00:31:48,830
Do we have 'em down here?

470
00:31:48,997 --> 00:31:50,624
I don't think so. No.

471
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:52,793
That's too bad.

472
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:55,003
Hope.

473
00:31:55,754 --> 00:31:57,422
You have to be Hope.

474
00:31:57,965 --> 00:32:00,217
She talked about you every day.

475
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:01,718
That's strange...

476
00:32:02,302 --> 00:32:04,054
she never said anything about you.

477
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:08,684
I don't think I would have told
my kid either.

478
00:32:09,685 --> 00:32:11,186
-Wild stuff.
-Funny.

479
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:12,855
How wild?

480
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:16,441
Very wild, Henry. Yeah.

481
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:21,113
Krylar, we need your help.

482
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:25,242
Janet, after all we've been through,
together...

483
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:26,493
just ask me.

484
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,161
Tell me, how can I help?

485
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:29,621
But...

486
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:32,833
is anyone starving? I'm starving.

487
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,126
Boys...

488
00:32:34,877 --> 00:32:35,878
Now.

489
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:45,262
They don't know anything.

490
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:48,515
About... anything.

491
00:32:48,682 --> 00:32:49,683
Then get them out of here.

492
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:52,686
Excuse me.

493
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:54,980
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

494
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:56,523
We're just trying to find our family.

495
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,816
Do you have a map?

496
00:32:57,983 --> 00:32:59,234
All we wanna do is go...

497
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:03,280
Wait, wait. Don't shoot.

498
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,573
They're with us.

499
00:33:06,491 --> 00:33:07,868
Is that building alive?

500
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,620
Yours are dead?

501
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:14,124
Look. Excuse me.

502
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,792
We just wanna go home.

503
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:22,049
At least you still have a home.

504
00:33:29,806 --> 00:33:31,350
What happened here?

505
00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:34,645
The Conqueror burned our homes.

506
00:33:35,395 --> 00:33:37,064
Our stories.

507
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:41,318
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

508
00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:43,987
Some of us escaped...

509
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:45,906
found others on the run.

510
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:48,534
We gathered who we could to fight.

511
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:50,786
It was never enough.

512
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,288
I'm sorry.

513
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:55,165
We can help.

514
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:03,173
-Cassie...
-Dad, you're an Avenger.

515
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,258
They need help.

516
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:06,343
No. What I need to do is get you home.

517
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:07,970
Why don't you wanna help?

518
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:09,346
We don't know anything about this place.

519
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:11,222
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

520
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,558
Have we been gone for 10 seconds?

521
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:13,724
Or have we been gone for 10 years?

522
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:15,018
Think about your mom right now.

523
00:34:15,184 --> 00:34:17,354
-Can you imagine what she must be...
-Don't use Mom as an excuse.

524
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:19,606
-You just don't care.
-No, I do care.

525
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:21,441
I know you wanna help. I do.

526
00:34:21,608 --> 00:34:23,402
But this is not our fight.

527
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:26,445
Just 'cause it's not happening to you
doesn't mean it's not happening.

528
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:28,949
Hey.

529
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,287
Would you look at me?

530
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:37,082
She's disappointed in you.

531
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:38,709
I got that. Yeah. Thank you.

532
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:39,710
You're welcome.

533
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:40,961
We'll talk about it later.

534
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:42,796
Right now, let's just find the others.

535
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:45,215
No one knows this place
better than Janet.

536
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:48,510
What did you say?

537
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,095
What?

538
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:51,471
That name.

539
00:34:52,597 --> 00:34:54,141
Janet Van Dyne.

540
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:55,267
Where is she?

541
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:57,186
That's what we're trying to find out.
You know her?

542
00:34:57,686 --> 00:34:58,896
I know her.

543
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,481
She shouldn't be here.

544
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:05,235
Hey, bring a round of the chasers, please.

545
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:06,945
Yes, thank you.

546
00:35:07,112 --> 00:35:10,199
If you haven't had this, don't try it...

547
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:12,784
unless you want to change your life.

548
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:27,591
Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.

549
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:29,843
Two of them.

550
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,303
Human, like us.

551
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,096
Human, that's the word.

552
00:35:33,263 --> 00:35:36,350
Totally forgot what you call yourselves
up there.

553
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:37,518
Human.

554
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:40,187
Are you not human?

555
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:42,356
Not technically, but yes.

556
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:44,358
In the ways that matter.

557
00:35:48,987 --> 00:35:49,988
No!

558
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:54,868
Let us talk.

559
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:02,084
So, what is it that brings you to us, Janet?

560
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:05,921
If I remember correctly, you left.

561
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,383
You left all of us.

562
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,260
With him.

563
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,763
Janet, what is he talking about?

564
00:36:16,723 --> 00:36:19,560
You didn't tell them about him.

565
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:24,106
Did you say anything...

566
00:36:25,023 --> 00:36:26,233
about what you did here?

567
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:30,737
How many people died because of you?

568
00:36:35,784 --> 00:36:38,161
Does your family even know who you are?

569
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,000
Your mommy...

570
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:46,295
is full of secrets.

571
00:36:46,461 --> 00:36:47,546
You're lying.

572
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:48,839
I lie.

573
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,175
A lot.

574
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,596
Not about this.

575
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:58,682
Let them go.

576
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:02,477
He just wants me.

577
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:04,021
But you want them.

578
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:06,982
So they're coming too.

579
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:11,278
Along with those other friends of yours.

580
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:14,531
I heard about them.

581
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:16,909
But he did too.

582
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:20,329
And he sent the Hunter.

583
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,497
What kind of hunter?

584
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:25,876
Not a man. Not a machine.

585
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:29,922
A mechanized organism designed only...

586
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:31,798
for killing.

587
00:37:33,926 --> 00:37:35,219
Where are they?

588
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:36,678
No clue.

589
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:38,931
Dead.

590
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:42,518
Probably dead.

591
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:59,034
This is so sad when all of this...

592
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:00,744
could have been avoided, Janet.

593
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,039
Just give him what he wants.

594
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,710
What happened to you?

595
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:14,508
We fought against him.

596
00:38:16,593 --> 00:38:18,470
He can be very persuasive.

597
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:22,057
Let's pay him a visit.

598
00:38:26,144 --> 00:38:27,521
I think we're done here.

599
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:46,748
Can that ship get us out of here?

600
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:50,210
Cover me?

601
00:38:50,377 --> 00:38:51,461
Always.

602
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,494
Henry, take the helm.

603
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:26,663
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

604
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,377
Where are the controls?

605
00:39:32,878 --> 00:39:34,171
Those are the controls.

606
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:39,009
What the hell?

607
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,053
You'll be great. It's like flying a bike.

608
00:39:43,388 --> 00:39:45,390
Is the bike alive?

609
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:00,614
Hands, all the way in!

610
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:02,741
Like stuffing a turkey.

611
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:12,834
-Really, him?
-He used to be charming.

612
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:13,752
That guy?

613
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:15,754
I was down here for 30 years, Henry.

614
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:17,631
-I had needs.
-Oh, my God.

615
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:19,591
Look, I get it. I've got needs too.

616
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:20,759
Oh, my God!

617
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:23,011
I had dinner with someone a few times.

618
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,055
Her name was Linda.

619
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:27,015
It didn't work out.

620
00:40:27,182 --> 00:40:28,433
What went wrong?

621
00:40:28,892 --> 00:40:30,477
She wasn't you, baby.

622
00:40:33,856 --> 00:40:36,775
-Get everyone in the ships. We're leaving.
-All right.

623
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:38,735
-And, Xolum.
-Right here.

624
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:41,113
Take them as far away from here as you can.

625
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,322
-Why?
-What?

626
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:45,659
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

627
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:55,878
You led them straight to us.

628
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:57,754
Come on, come on.

629
00:40:58,505 --> 00:40:59,840
Take as many as you can.

630
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:01,216
We'll hold them off.

631
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,449
Go!

632
00:41:27,075 --> 00:41:28,493
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

633
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:30,621
We gotta go! We gotta go!

634
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:31,830
Get on. Get on now!

635
00:41:31,997 --> 00:41:33,248
We have to go now. Now!

636
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:52,226
Oh, my God!

637
00:42:09,993 --> 00:42:11,328
Cassie, let's go!

638
00:42:18,544 --> 00:42:19,836
Get to the sanctuary.

639
00:42:20,587 --> 00:42:21,672
Wait for my message.

640
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,091
-Veb, we're leaving.
-No. No, wait!

641
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:26,301
-Move! Move!
-All my friends.

642
00:42:48,615 --> 00:42:49,700
Give up the travelers.

643
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,159
The Conqueror will show you mercy.

644
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:52,703
I know his mercy.

645
00:43:06,341 --> 00:43:07,426
Stay here. I'm...

646
00:43:08,677 --> 00:43:09,678
Cassie?

647
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:12,389
Oh, no.

648
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:37,039
Okay. I have a suit.

649
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:38,957
Yeah, I noticed.

650
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:41,001
-You okay?
-Yes.

651
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:44,004
Look, momentum, right?

652
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:46,089
Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.

653
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:47,341
I know how to do it, Dad.

654
00:43:47,508 --> 00:43:48,509
-Do you? Really?
-Yes.

655
00:43:48,675 --> 00:43:49,843
'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.

656
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,303
I messed up on the timing.

657
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,304
Jump...

658
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:58,810
Like that.

659
00:43:58,977 --> 00:44:00,395
You see what I did? You see what I did?

660
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:02,606
No. You're like this small.

661
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:03,982
I jumped and tapped.

662
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:16,203
Jentorra, we have to go.

663
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:38,559
Get to the ship!

664
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:29,193
Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott.

665
00:45:29,943 --> 00:45:32,529
I've been waiting a long time for this.

666
00:45:33,238 --> 00:45:34,323
What?

667
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,034
Is someone in there?

668
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,161
Oh, yes.

669
00:45:39,328 --> 00:45:41,914
The destiny you cannot escape.

670
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,209
Our fates have always been forged together...

671
00:45:47,502 --> 00:45:49,379
ever since that day we met.

672
00:45:51,798 --> 00:45:53,217
Scott Lang.

673
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:54,468
Get away from us!

674
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:56,178
The day you broke me.

675
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:01,225
-Banished me down here.
-Wait.

676
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,561
Darren?

677
00:46:06,355 --> 00:46:07,856
Surprised to see me?

678
00:46:09,775 --> 00:46:10,859
Yeah.

679
00:46:11,026 --> 00:46:12,152
It's the bee guy?

680
00:46:12,611 --> 00:46:14,363
-It's the bee guy?
-Cassie?

681
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,198
I almost didn't recognize you.

682
00:46:17,115 --> 00:46:18,742
How are you not dead?

683
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,827
I became the ultimate weapon.

684
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,164
That's what this is?

685
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,291
Look, Darren.

686
00:46:30,462 --> 00:46:31,713
Darren is dead!

687
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,384
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

688
00:46:36,552 --> 00:46:38,554
And there's no place you can run, Scott.

689
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,847
Not from me.

690
00:46:40,472 --> 00:46:42,099
And not from him.

691
00:46:43,141 --> 00:46:45,310
He's the future.

692
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:47,187
He's the past.

693
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:51,233
And now all he needs is you.

694
00:46:57,531 --> 00:46:58,657
Mom?

695
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:00,826
What's after Scott and Cassie?

696
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:04,162
We have to find them.

697
00:47:05,247 --> 00:47:06,957
There's something I have to do first.

698
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,542
They could be dead!

699
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:10,168
Hope, please.

700
00:47:10,377 --> 00:47:11,962
And you're still hiding things from us.

701
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,423
I am trying to protect you.

702
00:47:15,007 --> 00:47:16,008
From what?

703
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,512
Who are you so afraid of?

704
00:47:33,066 --> 00:47:34,443
Third time in jail?

705
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,613
Four.

706
00:47:46,413 --> 00:47:48,415
And here we are again.

707
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:51,043
Face to face.

708
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:55,047
That's a face.

709
00:47:56,465 --> 00:47:57,674
It's a big face.

710
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,426
Why are you just a floating head?

711
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:01,678
Maybe you could walk us through this, Darren.

712
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:04,765
You left Darren to die in the Quantum Realm.

713
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:08,393
But the Conqueror found me.

714
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,103
Rebuilt me.

715
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,314
Made me the ultimate weapon.

716
00:48:12,981 --> 00:48:15,776
A mechanized organism designed
only for...

717
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:16,944
M.O.D.O.K.?

718
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,365
I get it. It's an acronym.

719
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:22,699
It's an acronym.

720
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,869
Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

721
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:28,914
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

722
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:32,501
-I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.
-Just now noticing the baby legs.

723
00:48:33,252 --> 00:48:34,253
They're not baby legs.

724
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:35,796
A little bit like a Björn.

725
00:48:35,963 --> 00:48:37,297
You think you're so smart.

726
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,592
Scott Lang,
the man who took everything from me.

727
00:48:40,759 --> 00:48:42,177
Who stole my whole life.

728
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:43,470
But I did it.

729
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,598
I got you here.

730
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:48,767
I found your signal, Cassie.

731
00:48:48,934 --> 00:48:51,520
Thanks for that, by the way.
Couldn't have done it without you.

732
00:48:54,773 --> 00:48:56,775
You're looking at a man set free.

733
00:48:57,776 --> 00:49:01,446
I've created so much more here
than you could possibly imagine.

734
00:49:02,614 --> 00:49:05,242
All for him.

735
00:49:07,995 --> 00:49:11,081
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

736
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:16,169
What is this place?

737
00:49:17,462 --> 00:49:19,339
He said he was a traveler.

738
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:22,551
A scientist who crashed off course.

739
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,727
He had a ship...

740
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:35,272
beyond anything I had ever seen.

741
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:38,984
A ship that could travel the Multiverse.

742
00:49:39,151 --> 00:49:40,360
The Multiverse?

743
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:43,906
As in alternate dimensions?

744
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:45,908
Parallel realities?

745
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:47,701
I didn't believe it at first.

746
00:49:49,912 --> 00:49:50,913
But it's real.

747
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:54,124
Just like we theorized.

748
00:49:56,668 --> 00:49:58,378
Can this take us home?

749
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:01,757
It can take you anywhere.

750
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:22,819
I'd never met anyone like him.

751
00:50:25,197 --> 00:50:27,324
He felt so...

752
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:28,825
lost.

753
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:31,745
I guess we both were.

754
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:34,081
But we had a way out.

755
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,460
We tried everything...

756
00:50:38,627 --> 00:50:41,421
to recharge his ship's energy core.

757
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,595
Nothing worked.

758
00:50:50,138 --> 00:50:54,810
But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.

759
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:57,521
I lied to Hope.

760
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:03,735
I told her I was coming home.

761
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:09,741
I can see her by the door.

762
00:51:12,244 --> 00:51:13,662
Waiting for me.

763
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,209
That's the last thing I did...

764
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:23,046
was lie to her.

765
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:28,886
I just thought I'd have more time.

766
00:51:33,765 --> 00:51:35,184
I can give that to you.

767
00:51:37,186 --> 00:51:38,187
Time.

768
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:43,442
It's not what you think it is.

769
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:49,156
It's a cage.

770
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,326
And it does everything it can...

771
00:51:52,993 --> 00:51:54,077
to break you.

772
00:51:57,289 --> 00:52:00,542
It's not until you free yourself from it
that you see...

773
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,128
just how small...

774
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:05,339
it always was.

775
00:52:11,136 --> 00:52:13,013
We're going to get out of here.

776
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,768
She's gonna open the door...

777
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:20,812
and you'll be there.

778
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:26,610
I promise.

779
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:33,033
-Let's get to work.
-Okay.

780
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:39,081
It took ages, but we did it.

781
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:43,043
We brought it back to life.

782
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,672
Let's go home.

783
00:52:51,218 --> 00:52:53,095
His ship was neurokinetic.

784
00:52:54,263 --> 00:52:55,722
Connected to his thoughts.

785
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:00,727
When I touched it...

786
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,565
I saw his mind.

787
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:06,692
I felt...

788
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,862
what he had done.

789
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,492
Entire worlds...

790
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,370
entire timelines.

791
00:53:18,537 --> 00:53:22,541
Gone, like they never even existed.

792
00:53:40,976 --> 00:53:41,977
Janet?

793
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:47,983
We can leave.

794
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:51,195
Right now.

795
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,826
Who is Kang?

796
00:54:03,165 --> 00:54:04,583
Who I need to be.

797
00:54:08,921 --> 00:54:10,255
He didn't crash here.

798
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:12,466
He was exiled here.

799
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,720
Outside space and time.

800
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,556
The only place...

801
00:54:20,474 --> 00:54:22,100
that could hold him.

802
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,603
Exiled?

803
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:26,730
By who?

804
00:54:27,105 --> 00:54:28,106
I don't know.

805
00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:32,402
But they sabotaged his ship.

806
00:54:33,695 --> 00:54:35,447
And trapped him here.

807
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:39,284
And because of me...

808
00:54:40,702 --> 00:54:42,079
he was getting out.

809
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:43,080
Janet?

810
00:54:46,124 --> 00:54:47,417
Stay away.

811
00:54:53,048 --> 00:54:54,716
You saved my life.

812
00:55:00,055 --> 00:55:01,390
I made a promise.

813
00:55:08,355 --> 00:55:09,982
Just let me take you home.

814
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:12,818
And then?

815
00:55:14,987 --> 00:55:16,738
What are you going to do?

816
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,418
Win.

817
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:51,190
I told you time isn't what you think.

818
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:54,985
I can make it...

819
00:55:55,777 --> 00:55:57,863
so you never left her.

820
00:55:59,198 --> 00:56:02,409
Hope is going to open the door...

821
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,162
and you'll be there.

822
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,498
And how many worlds will die...

823
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,585
if you get out?

824
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,171
Not yours.

825
00:56:15,923 --> 00:56:17,549
She'll never know.

826
00:56:22,304 --> 00:56:24,848
Don't you want to see your daughter again?

827
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:28,727
I can't let you leave.

828
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:33,190
Why do you think you can stop me?

829
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:52,543
Give it to me, Janet.

830
00:56:54,002 --> 00:56:55,128
Give it to me!

831
00:56:55,587 --> 00:56:58,549
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

832
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:00,425
What did you do?

833
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,431
I'm sorry, Hope.

834
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:09,977
No!

835
00:57:37,212 --> 00:57:38,922
I blew up his core.

836
00:57:39,131 --> 00:57:41,300
Cut him off from time.

837
00:57:41,717 --> 00:57:44,636
And trapped us both down here forever.

838
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,599
But I gave him back enough.

839
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,392
Now that he had his suit back...

840
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,937
he became what he always was.

841
00:57:54,855 --> 00:57:56,523
A conqueror.

842
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,276
He's got weapons and technology...

843
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:03,113
centuries beyond anything we can dream of.

844
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,743
He took his prison and made it his empire.

845
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:12,039
I spent years fighting him...

846
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:14,791
running from him, hiding from him.

847
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:17,920
And then you saved me.

848
00:58:21,256 --> 00:58:22,257
You brought me home.

849
00:58:24,176 --> 00:58:25,219
But I didn't deserve it.

850
00:58:27,012 --> 00:58:30,599
I unleashed a monster on this place...

851
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:32,601
and ran away.

852
00:58:33,018 --> 00:58:36,438
Janet, you couldn't have known.

853
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:40,567
I'm sorry I never told you.

854
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:43,529
I just wanted to forget.

855
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,366
I just wanted to be your mom again.

856
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:55,707
I'm so sorry you had to go through
all of that alone.

857
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:59,294
But you are not alone now.

858
00:59:02,965 --> 00:59:04,383
We'll stop him together.

859
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:06,885
He's after the core.

860
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,389
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

861
00:59:10,556 --> 00:59:13,934
And if he's got Scott and Cassie,
he's got Pym Particles.

862
00:59:14,101 --> 00:59:15,936
-And a head start.
-Exactly.

863
00:59:16,103 --> 00:59:17,729
-We gotta get out of here.
-Hope.

864
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,898
He cannot get out.

865
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,921
You're an interesting man...

866
00:59:46,592 --> 00:59:48,010
Scott Lang.

867
00:59:49,678 --> 00:59:50,888
I don't know who you are...

868
00:59:52,264 --> 00:59:53,849
but you've made a big mistake.

869
00:59:54,474 --> 00:59:55,517
Okay?

870
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:57,978
I'm an Avenger.

871
00:59:58,812 --> 01:00:00,189
I've called the other Avengers...

872
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:01,899
You're an Avenger?

873
01:00:04,193 --> 01:00:06,069
Have I killed you before?

874
01:00:07,029 --> 01:00:08,030
What?

875
01:00:08,864 --> 01:00:10,782
They all blur together after a while.

876
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:14,661
You're not the one with the hammer?

877
01:00:14,828 --> 01:00:16,163
No, that's Thor.

878
01:00:18,123 --> 01:00:19,124
We get confused a lot.

879
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:21,501
Similar body types.
Who are you?

880
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:25,047
Just a man...

881
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,716
who's lost a lot of time.

882
01:00:27,883 --> 01:00:29,051
Like you.

883
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,430
But we can help each other with that.

884
01:00:35,224 --> 01:00:37,434
M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief.

885
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,895
Yeah, he stole something from me.

886
01:00:41,563 --> 01:00:43,899
Do not speak when I am in the room.

887
01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:54,284
Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.

888
01:00:54,993 --> 01:00:56,328
You know Janet too?

889
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:59,790
Does everyone down here know Janet?

890
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:02,709
She didn't tell you about me?

891
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:08,966
I guess that's not a surprise.

892
01:01:11,593 --> 01:01:13,679
Janet stole something from me.

893
01:01:14,596 --> 01:01:17,224
My ticket out of here.

894
01:01:19,935 --> 01:01:22,855
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

895
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:24,773
And why would I do that?

896
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,442
Because you want to get out of here.

897
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:32,197
And I need to get out of here.

898
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:36,368
Because I know how it ends.

899
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:38,245
How what ends?

900
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,958
All of it.

901
01:01:46,378 --> 01:01:49,506
I don't live in a straight line.

902
01:01:52,259 --> 01:01:53,802
And with time...

903
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:55,888
it's hard...

904
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:58,056
not to skip to the end.

905
01:01:59,808 --> 01:02:02,019
So, if you want to stop what's coming...

906
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:05,063
and trust me...

907
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,481
you do...

908
01:02:08,775 --> 01:02:10,903
I am the only shot you have.

909
01:02:11,612 --> 01:02:12,738
What's coming?

910
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:15,866
Me.

911
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:20,412
A lot of me.

912
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:28,420
They exiled me, down here.

913
01:02:31,673 --> 01:02:33,342
They're afraid of me.

914
01:02:39,306 --> 01:02:42,518
But I'm the man who can get you home.

915
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:54,404
So, do we have a deal?

916
01:02:57,783 --> 01:02:59,701
No, I don't think we do.

917
01:03:09,211 --> 01:03:10,045
Dad!

918
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:12,506
Let me make this easy for you.

919
01:03:12,673 --> 01:03:14,383
You will bring me what I need...

920
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:16,844
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you...

921
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,096
then make you relive that moment...

922
01:03:19,263 --> 01:03:22,558
over and over again in time, endlessly...

923
01:03:22,724 --> 01:03:25,185
until you beg me to kill you.

924
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:27,855
Do we understand?

925
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:32,609
Don't do this.

926
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,657
I'm a man who likes to be understood.

927
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:42,911
Dad.

928
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,038
Don't listen to him.

929
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:48,667
No! No!

930
01:03:48,834 --> 01:03:49,877
Look, we can talk about this.

931
01:03:50,335 --> 01:03:51,461
Don't do it!

932
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:53,088
You really should do it.

933
01:03:53,255 --> 01:03:54,256
Please.

934
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:58,135
That's my daughter, please.

935
01:03:58,302 --> 01:04:00,762
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

936
01:04:00,929 --> 01:04:01,930
Please!

937
01:04:02,097 --> 01:04:03,348
You think I'm lying?

938
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,185
Do I look like a liar to you?

939
01:04:07,936 --> 01:04:08,937
Stop!

940
01:04:09,104 --> 01:04:10,606
-Dad!
-I'll do it. I'll do it.

941
01:04:10,772 --> 01:04:12,316
I'll do it. Just let her go.

942
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:14,026
Let her go. Let her go!

943
01:04:24,953 --> 01:04:26,205
You're out of your league.

944
01:04:28,248 --> 01:04:29,249
Ant-Man.

945
01:04:35,506 --> 01:04:37,299
Just be glad I need you.

946
01:04:50,562 --> 01:04:53,982
Don't touch her again.

947
01:04:54,441 --> 01:04:56,026
Then give me what I need.

948
01:04:57,778 --> 01:04:59,029
Where is it?

949
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:41,989
What is that?

950
01:05:42,155 --> 01:05:44,533
It was a multiversal engine core.

951
01:05:46,201 --> 01:05:49,663
A power source that can take you anywhere
in space and time.

952
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:53,000
Then Janet blew it up.

953
01:05:57,337 --> 01:05:58,672
It's in that?

954
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:00,716
It is that.

955
01:06:00,883 --> 01:06:02,926
And we have to get to the center.

956
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,179
That's good to know.

957
01:06:07,014 --> 01:06:10,225
You'll have to shrink down and
pass through the eye of the storm.

958
01:06:10,392 --> 01:06:13,020
Once you're inside, find the core...

959
01:06:13,187 --> 01:06:14,897
and size it back down.

960
01:06:15,063 --> 01:06:16,523
What does it look like?

961
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:18,901
When I steal something,
I usually know what I'm stealing.

962
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:20,694
You'll know it when you see it.

963
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:23,155
Get in and out as fast as you can.

964
01:06:23,322 --> 01:06:26,617
The longer you're in there,
the more your mind will come undone.

965
01:06:29,536 --> 01:06:30,537
Better hurry.

966
01:06:31,747 --> 01:06:32,706
Dad!

967
01:06:35,209 --> 01:06:36,543
I'm sorry.

968
01:06:37,002 --> 01:06:38,545
This is all my fault.

969
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:41,840
Hey, hey, hey.

970
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:43,217
No.

971
01:06:44,843 --> 01:06:46,053
I messed up.

972
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,554
Cassie.

973
01:06:48,514 --> 01:06:50,724
My whole life happened because I messed up.

974
01:06:52,184 --> 01:06:54,811
The only thing I didn't mess up is you.

975
01:06:58,023 --> 01:06:59,191
Dad!

976
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,859
It's okay.

977
01:07:01,026 --> 01:07:02,152
It's okay.

978
01:07:04,905 --> 01:07:06,365
I love you, Peanut.

979
01:07:07,574 --> 01:07:09,409
I love you too.

980
01:07:53,495 --> 01:07:55,163
Okay. I'm in.

981
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:00,460
Darren, can you hear me?

982
01:08:00,627 --> 01:08:01,545
Darren?

983
01:08:02,754 --> 01:08:03,755
Darren?

984
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:08,010
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

985
01:08:08,177 --> 01:08:09,261
What?

986
01:08:09,636 --> 01:08:11,221
-I'm in.
-Okay.

987
01:08:11,722 --> 01:08:14,474
Okay, so what do I do? What's the plan?

988
01:08:15,976 --> 01:08:17,144
Don't die?

989
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:20,772
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

990
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:22,107
Do you see it?

991
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:24,734
Yeah. I see it.

992
01:08:29,948 --> 01:08:31,366
I'm heading in.

993
01:08:34,745 --> 01:08:35,662
What the hell?

994
01:08:35,828 --> 01:08:36,705
What the hell?

995
01:08:36,872 --> 01:08:37,706
What the hell?

996
01:08:37,873 --> 01:08:40,583
I told you, Scott.
Getting in was just the beginning.

997
01:08:40,751 --> 01:08:41,877
You never said that.

998
01:08:42,043 --> 01:08:43,295
Why am I looking at another me?

999
01:08:43,462 --> 01:08:45,005
I'm not another me. You're another me.

1000
01:08:45,172 --> 01:08:46,089
You just came out...

1001
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:47,882
Why am I looking at another me?

1002
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:51,220
You're looking at the possibility
of another you.

1003
01:08:51,386 --> 01:08:53,138
You're in a Probability Storm.

1004
01:08:53,305 --> 01:08:55,431
What does any of that mean?

1005
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:57,266
-You don't know?
-Why would I know?

1006
01:08:57,434 --> 01:08:58,351
Because you got me in here.

1007
01:08:58,519 --> 01:08:59,728
So, I am the real one, huh?

1008
01:08:59,895 --> 01:09:00,812
No. I didn't say that.

1009
01:09:02,355 --> 01:09:03,607
-What the hell?
-What the hell?

1010
01:09:03,774 --> 01:09:04,690
-What the hell?
-What the hell?

1011
01:09:04,858 --> 01:09:05,900
-Wait. Wait, wait.
-What the hell?

1012
01:09:06,068 --> 01:09:07,109
What the hell?

1013
01:09:08,237 --> 01:09:09,196
What is this place?

1014
01:09:09,363 --> 01:09:11,448
It's a Probability Storm.

1015
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:14,451
Every choice you could make,
existing all at once.

1016
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:16,036
What is he saying? What's he saying?

1017
01:09:16,411 --> 01:09:18,622
-What's he saying?
-You're inside Schrödinger's box.

1018
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:19,790
And you're the cat.

1019
01:09:19,957 --> 01:09:21,416
-That doesn't make sense.
-Oh, I get it.

1020
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:23,292
Nobody move! All right? Nobody move!

1021
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,587
Why should we listen to you?
You're not even the real one.

1022
01:09:25,754 --> 01:09:26,797
-What the hell?
-Am I real?

1023
01:09:26,964 --> 01:09:27,840
-Am I real?
-Am I real?

1024
01:09:28,006 --> 01:09:29,299
-I am the real one!
-What the hell?

1025
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:31,385
What the hell. I'm the real one.

1026
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:33,053
Guys. Hey, relax.

1027
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:34,888
Take it easy. Breathe.

1028
01:09:35,055 --> 01:09:37,140
We'll figure this out. Together.

1029
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:38,308
Who are you?

1030
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:39,851
Why are you dressed like that?

1031
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,312
Because I work at Baskin-Robbins.

1032
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,230
This is my uniform.

1033
01:09:44,398 --> 01:09:45,690
These are normal clothes.

1034
01:09:45,858 --> 01:09:47,150
Why are you dressed like that?

1035
01:09:47,234 --> 01:09:48,777
-Do you have ice cream?
-Enough!

1036
01:09:48,944 --> 01:09:49,987
Let's do this!

1037
01:09:58,161 --> 01:09:59,663
Oh, we're all gonna die.

1038
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,041
Wait.

1039
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:04,877
Wait. Wait!

1040
01:10:05,043 --> 01:10:06,128
No! No!

1041
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,755
No! Wait! No!

1042
01:10:08,922 --> 01:10:10,257
I've got a read on Scott.

1043
01:10:25,898 --> 01:10:26,857
Out of the way!

1044
01:10:27,024 --> 01:10:29,109
-Mom! What is this?
-What are you doing?

1045
01:10:29,276 --> 01:10:31,028
Don't look at them.
They're just possibilities.

1046
01:10:32,321 --> 01:10:33,614
They're not you.

1047
01:10:33,947 --> 01:10:35,908
Scott, where are you?

1048
01:10:40,162 --> 01:10:41,163
Why am I here?

1049
01:10:42,164 --> 01:10:43,999
Don't worry. It'll work this time.

1050
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:45,959
What are you... Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.

1051
01:10:46,126 --> 01:10:48,629
-Stop! No!
-I got this, guys.

1052
01:10:54,009 --> 01:10:56,011
I got this!
I got it!

1053
01:11:00,432 --> 01:11:01,642
Scott, where are you?

1054
01:11:02,226 --> 01:11:03,227
Scott!

1055
01:11:06,688 --> 01:11:08,273
Where are you, Scott?

1056
01:11:09,608 --> 01:11:11,443
-I can't breathe.
-Ow, that's my neck.

1057
01:11:13,028 --> 01:11:14,154
Stop kicking me!

1058
01:11:16,823 --> 01:11:18,408
-My back!
-We're all gonna die!

1059
01:11:19,576 --> 01:11:20,577
Dad.

1060
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:24,665
Come back.

1061
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:26,583
Dad...

1062
01:11:27,376 --> 01:11:28,794
if you can hear me...

1063
01:11:29,378 --> 01:11:31,880
come back.
Just come back.

1064
01:11:32,923 --> 01:11:34,466
-Don't give up.
-Come on.

1065
01:11:35,342 --> 01:11:37,261
-Dad, just come back one more time.
-Come on.

1066
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:39,012
-She needs us.
-Please.

1067
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:40,764
-Yes, come on.
-Come back.

1068
01:11:40,848 --> 01:11:42,808
She needs us.
Let's do it together.

1069
01:11:42,891 --> 01:11:45,018
-Get him up! Get him up!
-Grab him! Grab him!

1070
01:11:45,102 --> 01:11:46,311
Let's go.

1071
01:11:47,229 --> 01:11:49,231
-Come on, lift him!
-Yes!

1072
01:11:49,398 --> 01:11:51,608
-I got ya, I got ya! Go.
-Come on. That's it.

1073
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:53,610
-Come on!
-Give him a boost! Give him a boost!

1074
01:11:55,821 --> 01:11:58,323
Come on, we're doing it for Cassie!
Fellas, let's go!

1075
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:00,200
Everyone together!

1076
01:12:00,367 --> 01:12:01,410
What are you doing?

1077
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,704
How are you able to do that?

1078
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:04,872
I'll tell you how.

1079
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:08,125
We all want the same thing.

1080
01:12:10,043 --> 01:12:11,753
And I'm coming, Cassie.

1081
01:12:20,387 --> 01:12:21,763
Go get her, pal.

1082
01:12:27,144 --> 01:12:28,687
Everyone, let's go!

1083
01:12:31,064 --> 01:12:32,316
Come on!

1084
01:12:40,282 --> 01:12:41,283
Come on, closer.

1085
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:42,326
Get him higher!

1086
01:12:42,492 --> 01:12:44,161
Hang on, guys, hang on.

1087
01:12:45,454 --> 01:12:46,997
Careful. Steady, steady.

1088
01:12:50,042 --> 01:12:51,835
Steady. That's it.

1089
01:12:52,002 --> 01:12:53,003
Let's go.

1090
01:12:59,384 --> 01:13:00,385
What?

1091
01:13:03,931 --> 01:13:05,557
-Oh no.
-What happened? Did it work?

1092
01:13:05,724 --> 01:13:07,434
Sorry, buddy!

1093
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:09,353
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

1094
01:13:19,446 --> 01:13:21,448
Hope, are you real?

1095
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:23,283
I'm real.

1096
01:13:23,909 --> 01:13:24,910
Then let's do this.

1097
01:13:29,915 --> 01:13:31,208
You ready?

1098
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:32,376
Ready.

1099
01:14:18,422 --> 01:14:19,464
Come on.

1100
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:20,716
We gotta get that thing out of here.

1101
01:14:20,883 --> 01:14:21,717
No, no, no. Wait.

1102
01:14:21,884 --> 01:14:22,968
He's got Cassie.

1103
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:24,761
-What?
-Scott.

1104
01:14:25,304 --> 01:14:27,389
-Janet.
-Give that to me.

1105
01:14:27,556 --> 01:14:28,432
-We have to go now.
-No.

1106
01:14:28,599 --> 01:14:29,808
He's got Cassie.

1107
01:14:30,184 --> 01:14:32,644
We will save her. I promise you
we will save her...

1108
01:14:34,146 --> 01:14:36,023
but you cannot give that to him.

1109
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,649
I wouldn't trust her.

1110
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:43,363
Janet has a way of...

1111
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:47,868
changing her mind.

1112
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:57,211
Hello, Jellybean.

1113
01:15:03,383 --> 01:15:04,468
So...

1114
01:15:08,263 --> 01:15:09,890
what's it gonna be, Scott?

1115
01:15:13,477 --> 01:15:15,729
Well, well.

1116
01:15:16,897 --> 01:15:19,733
If it isn't my old mentor.

1117
01:15:24,279 --> 01:15:25,113
Hi, Hank.

1118
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:29,701
Darren?

1119
01:15:30,369 --> 01:15:32,788
Didn't expect to see
your protégé again after all...

1120
01:15:32,955 --> 01:15:34,665
Holy shit, Darren.

1121
01:15:35,624 --> 01:15:36,959
What happened to you?

1122
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:39,586
I'm the ultimate weapon!

1123
01:15:50,222 --> 01:15:51,849
Do I need to take it?

1124
01:15:52,307 --> 01:15:53,475
Where is my daughter?

1125
01:15:55,561 --> 01:15:56,562
Scott.

1126
01:15:57,896 --> 01:15:58,897
Don't.

1127
01:15:59,815 --> 01:16:02,025
We had a deal.

1128
01:16:02,651 --> 01:16:04,027
She'll be fine without you.

1129
01:16:29,553 --> 01:16:31,180
So long, Hank.

1130
01:16:38,729 --> 01:16:39,730
Henry.

1131
01:16:46,904 --> 01:16:49,198
You left me right here to die.

1132
01:16:53,368 --> 01:16:54,828
Let's see how they do.

1133
01:17:55,639 --> 01:17:57,099
What did you see?

1134
01:18:05,858 --> 01:18:09,194
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

1135
01:18:11,196 --> 01:18:12,322
But I always wondered.

1136
01:18:16,118 --> 01:18:18,036
When you touched my mind...

1137
01:18:29,506 --> 01:18:31,216
what did you see?

1138
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,302
A monster...

1139
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:36,221
who thinks he's a god.

1140
01:18:36,638 --> 01:18:39,057
When you can see time the way I do...

1141
01:18:39,224 --> 01:18:41,143
you don't get to close your eyes.

1142
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:44,021
And you're the only one who sees?

1143
01:18:44,188 --> 01:18:48,901
I am the only one that can see it's broken.

1144
01:18:49,193 --> 01:18:50,360
And who broke it?

1145
01:18:52,863 --> 01:18:54,031
I did.

1146
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,243
Every version of me.

1147
01:18:59,411 --> 01:19:00,871
My variants.

1148
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,956
Throughout the Multiverse.

1149
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:08,462
Playing with time, like children.

1150
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:13,884
But I saw how it ends.

1151
01:19:15,177 --> 01:19:17,179
I saw their chaos...

1152
01:19:17,971 --> 01:19:20,933
spreading across realities.

1153
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,353
Universes colliding.

1154
01:19:25,812 --> 01:19:27,064
Endless incursions.

1155
01:19:28,398 --> 01:19:30,359
I saw the Multiverse.

1156
01:19:31,527 --> 01:19:32,945
And it was dying.

1157
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,989
All because of them.

1158
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:39,326
So, I took control.

1159
01:19:40,035 --> 01:19:41,870
You mean you started a war.

1160
01:19:42,704 --> 01:19:45,958
And now you wanna wipe away
any universe that's a threat to you.

1161
01:19:47,084 --> 01:19:48,710
That's what monsters do.

1162
01:19:48,877 --> 01:19:51,713
That's what conquerors do.

1163
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,967
They burn the broken world.

1164
01:19:55,968 --> 01:19:58,762
And they make a new one.

1165
01:19:58,929 --> 01:20:01,807
You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.

1166
01:20:03,934 --> 01:20:06,270
You only want revenge because they beat you.

1167
01:20:07,187 --> 01:20:08,146
Because you lost.

1168
01:20:08,522 --> 01:20:10,357
I have lost.

1169
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:16,154
You have no idea what I have lost.

1170
01:20:17,698 --> 01:20:21,577
And I will burn them out of time...

1171
01:20:21,743 --> 01:20:23,161
for what they've done to me.

1172
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:28,083
You'll be wiping out entire timelines.

1173
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:31,920
Murdering trillions of people.

1174
01:20:33,338 --> 01:20:35,841
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1175
01:20:57,821 --> 01:20:59,281
Oh, God. What am I doing?

1176
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,251
What?

1177
01:21:15,464 --> 01:21:16,381
Hank!

1178
01:21:20,093 --> 01:21:21,386
Are these your ants?

1179
01:21:22,054 --> 01:21:23,138
From the ant farm?

1180
01:21:23,305 --> 01:21:25,182
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1181
01:21:25,557 --> 01:21:26,975
How did you find them down here?

1182
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,146
I've been picking up strange signals
ever since we crashed.

1183
01:21:33,315 --> 01:21:35,943
First I thought maybe it was a malfunction.

1184
01:21:36,109 --> 01:21:37,694
Some kind of interference.

1185
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:39,738
What is that?

1186
01:21:39,905 --> 01:21:41,031
But it wasn't.

1187
01:21:42,407 --> 01:21:43,617
It was the ants.

1188
01:21:45,577 --> 01:21:48,455
They were reaching out the whole time.

1189
01:21:49,915 --> 01:21:53,377
Apparently, they passed through
some sort of time dilation.

1190
01:21:53,961 --> 01:21:56,755
They've lived thousands of years
in a single day...

1191
01:21:57,339 --> 01:22:00,342
expanding their knowledge,
their science...

1192
01:22:00,634 --> 01:22:03,512
becoming more advanced
than I could have ever thought.

1193
01:22:03,846 --> 01:22:05,264
I didn't find them.

1194
01:22:06,139 --> 01:22:07,391
They found me.

1195
01:22:09,476 --> 01:22:11,103
I told you they were smart.

1196
01:22:13,564 --> 01:22:18,569
They've already built something
of a technocratic Class-Two civilization.

1197
01:22:18,861 --> 01:22:21,738
I mean, I know socialism is a charged word...

1198
01:22:21,905 --> 01:22:24,783
-but we could learn a lot from these...
-Dad.

1199
01:22:25,868 --> 01:22:27,160
Yeah, they're my ants.

1200
01:22:27,911 --> 01:22:29,913
And ants don't give up.

1201
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,331
I don't care who this guy is.

1202
01:22:31,498 --> 01:22:32,708
I don't care what he can do.

1203
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:33,917
I'm getting Cassie.

1204
01:22:34,251 --> 01:22:36,503
So, how do we even the odds against Kang?

1205
01:22:39,631 --> 01:22:41,049
We've got some ideas.

1206
01:22:41,216 --> 01:22:42,217
What are you thinking?

1207
01:22:42,384 --> 01:22:45,387
Well, as a great writer once said...

1208
01:22:46,346 --> 01:22:48,599
"There's always room to grow."

1209
01:22:50,976 --> 01:22:52,060
You read my book?

1210
01:22:52,769 --> 01:22:56,148
Every goddamn word.

1211
01:22:58,775 --> 01:23:00,152
Come on. Let's go to work.

1212
01:23:13,081 --> 01:23:14,917
Hey! I'm sorry.

1213
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:16,919
That was probably terrifying.

1214
01:23:17,085 --> 01:23:18,378
What are you doing here?

1215
01:23:19,087 --> 01:23:20,255
I'm rescuing you.

1216
01:23:20,631 --> 01:23:21,632
How?

1217
01:23:23,217 --> 01:23:24,843
That's a good question.

1218
01:23:25,469 --> 01:23:28,138
Does this thing have like a key?

1219
01:23:28,305 --> 01:23:30,307
Or a card? Like a room key?

1220
01:23:30,474 --> 01:23:31,683
Do you know, like a...

1221
01:23:33,644 --> 01:23:34,645
Shit!

1222
01:23:42,361 --> 01:23:43,362
Jump and tap.

1223
01:23:52,371 --> 01:23:53,413
Jentorra.

1224
01:23:54,831 --> 01:23:56,625
I'm sorry I got your people hurt.

1225
01:23:58,335 --> 01:23:59,336
How can I help?

1226
01:24:04,508 --> 01:24:05,551
Wow.

1227
01:24:05,717 --> 01:24:06,885
Let's hurt 'em back.

1228
01:24:08,095 --> 01:24:09,304
Damn, you're cool.

1229
01:24:10,222 --> 01:24:11,181
Do you have a plan?

1230
01:24:11,348 --> 01:24:12,599
Freeing you was basically my plan.

1231
01:24:13,725 --> 01:24:14,810
Do you have a plan?

1232
01:24:14,977 --> 01:24:17,020
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

1233
01:24:17,688 --> 01:24:19,356
Then free our people
from the detention cells below...

1234
01:24:19,523 --> 01:24:20,774
and launch a counteroffensive from within.

1235
01:24:20,941 --> 01:24:23,110
Yeah, you have a plan.
So, how do we get a message out?

1236
01:24:23,277 --> 01:24:24,236
Follow me.

1237
01:24:24,403 --> 01:24:25,904
Okay. Great.

1238
01:24:30,284 --> 01:24:33,161
I built an empire down here, Janet.

1239
01:24:35,622 --> 01:24:37,165
And I'm taking it with me.

1240
01:24:53,307 --> 01:24:56,059
You really should've let me out
when you had the chance.

1241
01:25:05,319 --> 01:25:08,447
History is not written.

1242
01:25:10,449 --> 01:25:11,700
It is forged.

1243
01:25:12,492 --> 01:25:14,328
Today, we ascend.

1244
01:25:15,204 --> 01:25:20,209
From this fortress, I will take my revenge
on those who banished me.

1245
01:25:21,668 --> 01:25:25,047
Today we conquer eternity.

1246
01:25:25,839 --> 01:25:28,008
And the dynasty of Kang shall...

1247
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:33,639
Hello? Is this working?

1248
01:25:34,223 --> 01:25:35,224
Cassie?

1249
01:25:35,390 --> 01:25:37,267
I can't tell if this is working.

1250
01:25:38,644 --> 01:25:40,145
Okay. I think we're on.

1251
01:25:40,312 --> 01:25:41,730
I'll hold them off. Get the message out.

1252
01:25:41,897 --> 01:25:43,565
I thought you were getting the message out.

1253
01:25:45,234 --> 01:25:46,068
Now!

1254
01:25:47,569 --> 01:25:49,738
We're inside.
We breached the tower.

1255
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:50,906
And I'm with Jentorra.

1256
01:25:51,073 --> 01:25:52,491
He's not invincible.

1257
01:25:58,705 --> 01:26:00,666
I know it might feel like...

1258
01:26:00,832 --> 01:26:02,209
it's too late...

1259
01:26:03,835 --> 01:26:05,921
like all we do is just lose.

1260
01:26:06,463 --> 01:26:08,048
But the family I've lost...

1261
01:26:08,674 --> 01:26:10,300
taught me to keep fighting.

1262
01:26:10,467 --> 01:26:12,344
And if they were here, they would too.

1263
01:26:13,178 --> 01:26:15,180
We need to look out for the little guy.

1264
01:26:15,722 --> 01:26:17,140
My dad taught me that.

1265
01:26:17,599 --> 01:26:19,351
'Cause when people needed help...

1266
01:26:19,935 --> 01:26:21,770
he didn't look the other way.

1267
01:26:22,271 --> 01:26:23,480
And neither do we.

1268
01:26:25,816 --> 01:26:26,775
We need to move!

1269
01:26:26,942 --> 01:26:29,278
Come to the tower! Fight back!

1270
01:26:29,444 --> 01:26:31,822
I know you've been waiting.
Now is the time to strike.

1271
01:26:31,989 --> 01:26:34,157
He knows he can't take all of us.

1272
01:26:34,324 --> 01:26:35,450
Come to the...

1273
01:26:35,617 --> 01:26:36,618
Cassie.

1274
01:26:36,785 --> 01:26:38,745
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1275
01:26:38,912 --> 01:26:40,539
-Let's go.
-I'll drive.

1276
01:26:46,628 --> 01:26:48,005
Find Lang's daughter.

1277
01:26:51,341 --> 01:26:52,384
Kill her.

1278
01:27:11,486 --> 01:27:12,529
Let's go. Let's go!

1279
01:27:13,113 --> 01:27:14,364
If you want to fight, follow me!

1280
01:27:19,203 --> 01:27:20,412
It's over, Cassie.

1281
01:27:20,829 --> 01:27:22,539
Free the others. Go!

1282
01:27:30,672 --> 01:27:31,757
He's gonna see us coming.

1283
01:27:31,924 --> 01:27:33,967
Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

1284
01:27:34,885 --> 01:27:36,053
Begin the launch.

1285
01:28:28,397 --> 01:28:30,232
Your dad's not here, Cassie...

1286
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:32,401
but I guess that's not a big surprise.

1287
01:28:55,841 --> 01:28:57,050
Kang!

1288
01:28:58,218 --> 01:29:00,053
We had a deal.

1289
01:29:02,181 --> 01:29:04,474
You took my daughter!

1290
01:29:06,894 --> 01:29:08,270
Holy shit.

1291
01:29:08,937 --> 01:29:10,105
That's big.

1292
01:29:18,864 --> 01:29:20,490
You lied to me!

1293
01:29:21,783 --> 01:29:23,911
Our word is our bond.

1294
01:29:24,703 --> 01:29:27,873
Without that, we're nothing!

1295
01:29:28,665 --> 01:29:29,666
Bring him down.

1296
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:30,709
Yes, sir.

1297
01:29:37,466 --> 01:29:38,842
Keep going. I've got them.

1298
01:29:40,761 --> 01:29:42,095
Yeah, come on!

1299
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:57,819
There's so many!

1300
01:29:57,986 --> 01:30:00,239
Scott! I can't hold them!

1301
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:12,376
They came.

1302
01:30:14,127 --> 01:30:16,129
Way to go, Cassie!

1303
01:30:18,549 --> 01:30:19,633
Yes!

1304
01:30:19,967 --> 01:30:22,386
Come on! Let's go!

1305
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:29,268
Revolution!

1306
01:30:42,447 --> 01:30:44,491
Burn it all down.

1307
01:30:44,658 --> 01:30:45,868
Fight!

1308
01:31:03,093 --> 01:31:04,970
Cover! Get down!

1309
01:31:13,645 --> 01:31:15,147
What is the bridge code?

1310
01:31:15,689 --> 01:31:16,815
I'll die first.

1311
01:31:17,441 --> 01:31:18,650
One-eight-one-four-seven.

1312
01:31:19,109 --> 01:31:19,985
Damn!

1313
01:31:35,417 --> 01:31:36,585
You'll need this.

1314
01:31:39,046 --> 01:31:39,796
Hi.

1315
01:31:40,714 --> 01:31:41,673
This is our home!

1316
01:31:42,674 --> 01:31:44,051
Let's take it back!

1317
01:31:48,555 --> 01:31:49,556
No!

1318
01:31:56,855 --> 01:31:58,815
I have holes.

1319
01:32:00,609 --> 01:32:03,237
I have holes!

1320
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:11,245
I didn't know he could do that.

1321
01:32:20,963 --> 01:32:21,964
Kang!

1322
01:32:22,548 --> 01:32:23,841
Where is she?

1323
01:32:24,508 --> 01:32:25,759
Launch now!

1324
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,522
What is that?

1325
01:32:38,897 --> 01:32:40,357
He's getting out.

1326
01:32:40,732 --> 01:32:41,942
Oh, no, he's not.

1327
01:32:49,616 --> 01:32:51,159
Keep him away from the rings.

1328
01:33:30,407 --> 01:33:31,491
Dad!

1329
01:33:34,286 --> 01:33:35,621
Dad, I'm coming!

1330
01:33:47,174 --> 01:33:48,175
Dad!

1331
01:33:56,517 --> 01:33:58,018
Nowhere left to run.

1332
01:34:06,985 --> 01:34:08,111
Please let this work.

1333
01:34:26,547 --> 01:34:28,048
Hey, where do you think you're going?

1334
01:34:28,215 --> 01:34:29,174
Let's go.

1335
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:31,301
You think this is over? Come on! Let's go.

1336
01:34:31,468 --> 01:34:33,053
Darren, just stop...

1337
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:35,848
trying to be whatever this is.

1338
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,141
I don't know what to be.

1339
01:34:40,227 --> 01:34:41,728
Tell me what to be.

1340
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:44,189
I don't know.
Just don't be a dick.

1341
01:34:44,898 --> 01:34:46,358
It's too late.

1342
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,110
Look at me.

1343
01:34:49,695 --> 01:34:51,238
I'm such a dick.

1344
01:34:51,655 --> 01:34:54,074
It's never too late to stop being a dick.

1345
01:34:59,788 --> 01:35:00,956
We've gotta stop him.

1346
01:35:02,791 --> 01:35:04,167
I have an idea.

1347
01:35:06,879 --> 01:35:07,713
Ready?

1348
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,047
Probably not.

1349
01:35:11,842 --> 01:35:14,303
One, two, three. Now!

1350
01:35:37,326 --> 01:35:38,660
Dad!

1351
01:35:38,952 --> 01:35:39,912
Dad!

1352
01:35:40,746 --> 01:35:41,747
Cassie?

1353
01:35:43,749 --> 01:35:44,625
You're huge.

1354
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:46,418
I'm huge.

1355
01:35:50,839 --> 01:35:52,424
I love you, Peanut.

1356
01:35:52,591 --> 01:35:53,926
I love you too.

1357
01:35:54,301 --> 01:35:55,886
I'm so proud of you.

1358
01:35:56,637 --> 01:35:58,680
I feel like I'm hugging Godzilla.

1359
01:35:58,847 --> 01:36:01,433
I know. It feels so cool.

1360
01:36:01,725 --> 01:36:03,393
I know, right?

1361
01:36:04,144 --> 01:36:05,270
I'm so hungry.

1362
01:36:05,437 --> 01:36:06,438
Yeah, that happens.

1363
01:36:06,605 --> 01:36:08,774
-I could eat everything.
-Everything. I know.

1364
01:36:09,316 --> 01:36:11,652
-But I really want like a lime.
-Right?

1365
01:36:11,818 --> 01:36:13,862
-Citrus. It's weird. I know.
-Citrus.

1366
01:36:14,029 --> 01:36:15,030
It's...

1367
01:36:25,874 --> 01:36:27,334
Take the tower!

1368
01:36:58,949 --> 01:37:00,200
It's over.

1369
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:04,121
You still can't see it.

1370
01:37:06,123 --> 01:37:09,001
It's never over.

1371
01:38:25,744 --> 01:38:27,496
-We have to go, right now.
-No.

1372
01:38:27,663 --> 01:38:28,664
-Come on.
-No!

1373
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:29,915
I know, I know, but we have to go.

1374
01:38:30,082 --> 01:38:31,458
-No!
-Come on.

1375
01:39:21,717 --> 01:39:22,926
You son of a...

1376
01:39:26,013 --> 01:39:27,514
-Oh, God.
-Scott.

1377
01:39:27,806 --> 01:39:28,807
Come on.

1378
01:39:33,562 --> 01:39:36,190
You think this is new to me?

1379
01:39:37,524 --> 01:39:42,237
Do you know how many rebellions
I have put down?

1380
01:39:43,947 --> 01:39:45,407
No, no, no.

1381
01:39:45,574 --> 01:39:49,077
How many worlds I've conquered?

1382
01:39:49,953 --> 01:39:52,164
How many Avengers I've killed?

1383
01:39:52,331 --> 01:39:54,875
And you think you can beat me?

1384
01:39:55,042 --> 01:39:56,668
I am Kang!

1385
01:39:56,835 --> 01:39:57,753
You...

1386
01:39:58,795 --> 01:40:01,048
You talk to ants.

1387
01:41:20,919 --> 01:41:23,463
My name is Darren...

1388
01:41:23,630 --> 01:41:28,135
and I am not a dick!

1389
01:41:49,656 --> 01:41:50,908
Sorry I'm late.

1390
01:41:53,202 --> 01:41:54,453
Lotta ants.

1391
01:41:55,871 --> 01:41:56,872
Oh, is this you?

1392
01:41:58,999 --> 01:42:00,459
You were right about me, Cassie.

1393
01:42:01,752 --> 01:42:02,753
Darren.

1394
01:42:04,546 --> 01:42:05,547
Are you okay?

1395
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:09,551
Probably not.

1396
01:42:10,886 --> 01:42:12,554
-Darren?
-Hi, Hope.

1397
01:42:13,514 --> 01:42:15,015
You changed your hair.

1398
01:42:17,726 --> 01:42:19,603
What the hell happened?

1399
01:42:20,354 --> 01:42:21,188
Yeah. No...

1400
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:23,190
It's a whole thing. I'll tell you later.

1401
01:42:23,982 --> 01:42:24,983
That was...

1402
01:42:25,526 --> 01:42:26,944
I don't know what to say.

1403
01:42:27,528 --> 01:42:28,820
Thanks, Scott.

1404
01:42:29,446 --> 01:42:32,658
You always were a brother to me.

1405
01:42:34,785 --> 01:42:35,786
I was?

1406
01:42:43,669 --> 01:42:44,753
I was.

1407
01:42:58,892 --> 01:43:00,561
And at least I died...

1408
01:43:02,104 --> 01:43:03,647
an Avenger.

1409
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:07,943
Yeah.

1410
01:43:08,986 --> 01:43:09,862
-You did.
-Yeah.

1411
01:43:10,737 --> 01:43:11,738
You're in.

1412
01:43:28,338 --> 01:43:29,965
A lot has happened today.

1413
01:43:30,757 --> 01:43:31,884
-Henry?
-Janet?

1414
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:33,886
-Mom, where are you?
-I'm in the tower.

1415
01:43:34,052 --> 01:43:36,054
I think I can give us one shot back.

1416
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:38,015
But we don't have much time.

1417
01:43:38,223 --> 01:43:39,850
If we wanna go home...

1418
01:43:42,311 --> 01:43:43,729
we have to go now.

1419
01:43:44,354 --> 01:43:45,355
We'll finish this.

1420
01:43:47,649 --> 01:43:48,692
Thank you.

1421
01:43:49,776 --> 01:43:50,652
Thank you.

1422
01:43:52,738 --> 01:43:54,281
Come on! Let's go!

1423
01:43:54,448 --> 01:43:55,657
All right. Good luck.

1424
01:43:56,033 --> 01:43:57,075
Good luck.
Come on.

1425
01:44:27,773 --> 01:44:28,774
Thanks, buddy.

1426
01:44:31,109 --> 01:44:32,110
You did it.

1427
01:44:35,906 --> 01:44:37,032
Let's go home.

1428
01:44:58,887 --> 01:44:59,888
Where's Scott?

1429
01:45:00,055 --> 01:45:01,598
He was right behind me.

1430
01:45:44,683 --> 01:45:46,268
You should've looked the other way.

1431
01:45:46,435 --> 01:45:49,104
Yeah, well, never been great at that.

1432
01:45:57,070 --> 01:45:58,530
And you're not getting out.

1433
01:46:09,124 --> 01:46:10,542
I want you to remember.

1434
01:46:12,044 --> 01:46:13,587
You could've gone home.

1435
01:46:28,727 --> 01:46:30,771
You could've seen your daughter again.

1436
01:46:44,535 --> 01:46:45,953
But you thought you could win.

1437
01:46:59,341 --> 01:47:00,843
I don't have to win.

1438
01:47:02,344 --> 01:47:04,263
We both just have to lose.

1439
01:47:55,355 --> 01:47:56,732
Dad!

1440
01:48:03,864 --> 01:48:04,865
Where... Where...

1441
01:48:05,157 --> 01:48:06,241
Where is she? Is she...

1442
01:48:06,408 --> 01:48:07,910
-No, she's okay.
-Where is she?

1443
01:48:08,076 --> 01:48:09,453
She's okay. She's okay.

1444
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:11,330
-Scott, they're all okay. They're all okay.
-She's safe?

1445
01:48:11,496 --> 01:48:12,497
You did it.

1446
01:48:12,664 --> 01:48:13,665
You did it.

1447
01:48:17,085 --> 01:48:19,004
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
-No, no, no.

1448
01:48:19,171 --> 01:48:20,589
No, don't let go. Don't let go.

1449
01:48:21,215 --> 01:48:22,382
Don't let go.

1450
01:48:22,549 --> 01:48:23,800
Don't ever let go.

1451
01:48:25,427 --> 01:48:26,762
I got you.

1452
01:48:29,556 --> 01:48:30,724
You came back.

1453
01:48:41,109 --> 01:48:42,402
I love you, Hope.

1454
01:48:45,072 --> 01:48:46,406
I love you, Scott.

1455
01:50:00,272 --> 01:50:01,607
Let's go home.

1456
01:50:04,276 --> 01:50:05,485
Home's good.

1457
01:50:13,911 --> 01:50:15,579
My life doesn't make sense.

1458
01:50:15,746 --> 01:50:18,081
I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.

1459
01:50:18,248 --> 01:50:20,959
"Scott you just saved the Quantum Realm
with your family...

1460
01:50:21,126 --> 01:50:23,003
"and drank a guy without holes.

1461
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:25,422
"Why does this kind of stuff keep
happening to you?

1462
01:50:25,589 --> 01:50:27,090
"That doesn't make any sense."

1463
01:50:27,257 --> 01:50:28,592
But you know what?

1464
01:50:28,759 --> 01:50:30,761
Who said life has to make sense?

1465
01:50:35,098 --> 01:50:36,099
Rubin!

1466
01:50:36,266 --> 01:50:37,476
You are the bug!

1467
01:50:38,727 --> 01:50:41,230
I was wrong. Yeah.
You are the other bug.

1468
01:50:41,396 --> 01:50:42,689
You're the bug man.

1469
01:50:42,856 --> 01:50:45,442
You get big and get small
like a big bug!

1470
01:50:46,109 --> 01:50:48,737
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

1471
01:50:48,904 --> 01:50:49,905
Twelve dollar.

1472
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:52,783
Twelve!

1473
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:55,494
I used to wonder if this
chapter in my life was over...

1474
01:50:55,661 --> 01:50:58,830
but as Cassie reminded me,
"There's always someone you can help."

1475
01:50:59,623 --> 01:51:02,000
Came out of cake making
retirement for you.

1476
01:51:04,461 --> 01:51:05,462
Wow.

1477
01:51:06,171 --> 01:51:07,464
You made this yourself?

1478
01:51:07,631 --> 01:51:10,050
-Yeah! I don't usually make the cakes.
-I know.

1479
01:51:10,217 --> 01:51:12,010
This is the first one I've made since 1997.

1480
01:51:12,177 --> 01:51:13,387
You're a real artist.

1481
01:51:13,554 --> 01:51:15,514
It's been a pretty wild ride.

1482
01:51:15,681 --> 01:51:18,100
One day you're fired from Baskin-Robbins...

1483
01:51:18,267 --> 01:51:21,061
the next you're beating a time-traveling
space king.

1484
01:51:22,145 --> 01:51:24,106
We did beat him, right?

1485
01:51:25,566 --> 01:51:26,775
I mean, yeah, that's what happened.

1486
01:51:26,942 --> 01:51:29,111
He was getting out and he didn't get out.

1487
01:51:30,571 --> 01:51:31,655
I think.

1488
01:51:33,156 --> 01:51:35,742
But he also said something bad was coming...

1489
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:39,246
and that everyone would die
if he didn't get out.

1490
01:51:39,413 --> 01:51:42,040
Wait. So, did I just kill everyone?

1491
01:51:42,749 --> 01:51:44,793
Is everyone gonna die because of me?

1492
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:46,086
Oh, my God.

1493
01:51:47,212 --> 01:51:48,672
Oh my... What did I do?

1494
01:51:50,883 --> 01:51:52,259
What did I do?

1495
01:51:55,762 --> 01:51:57,848
You know what? It's probably fine.

1496
01:51:58,390 --> 01:52:00,475
Like I said, life doesn't make any sense...

1497
01:52:00,642 --> 01:52:03,770
so maybe stop asking so
many questions, Scott.

1498
01:52:03,937 --> 01:52:05,397
Stop overthinking it.

1499
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:09,693
Surprise!

1500
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:13,989
Happy Birthday to you

1501
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:16,533
It's not my birthday.

1502
01:52:16,700 --> 01:52:19,203
I know. But I missed a few.

1503
01:52:21,622 --> 01:52:23,498
This is good. We're all together.

1504
01:52:23,874 --> 01:52:25,292
You're fine.

1505
01:52:25,459 --> 01:52:28,378
Everything's probably fine.

1506
01:52:28,545 --> 01:52:30,881
Kang's gone. You did it.

1507
01:52:32,007 --> 01:52:33,759
Don't have to worry about that guy anymore.

1508
01:52:33,926 --> 01:52:34,927
Thanks.

1509
01:52:38,430 --> 01:52:40,432
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1510
01:55:18,298 --> 01:55:21,885
So, the exiled one is dead.

1511
01:55:24,179 --> 01:55:26,098
You sure he's dead?

1512
01:55:26,723 --> 01:55:29,601
If it wasn't true, I wouldn't call you.

1513
01:55:30,227 --> 01:55:33,355
Must really eat you up,
that you're not the one who killed him.

1514
01:55:33,689 --> 01:55:36,358
None of us...

1515
01:55:37,192 --> 01:55:38,902
killed him.

1516
01:55:41,196 --> 01:55:42,573
They did.

1517
01:55:43,448 --> 01:55:47,995
They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.

1518
01:55:48,662 --> 01:55:50,122
And if we let them...

1519
01:55:50,581 --> 01:55:52,416
they will take...

1520
01:55:53,834 --> 01:55:55,460
everything...

1521
01:55:56,378 --> 01:55:58,380
we've built.

1522
01:55:59,423 --> 01:56:01,967
So let's stop wasting time.

1523
01:56:05,596 --> 01:56:06,805
We're late.

1524
01:56:08,807 --> 01:56:11,143
How many did you call?

1525
01:56:11,476 --> 01:56:13,896
All of us.

1526
02:03:36,797 --> 02:03:41,802
Time is everything.

1527
02:03:47,057 --> 02:03:50,060
It shapes our lives.

1528
02:03:51,353 --> 02:03:55,315
But, perhaps, we can shape...

1529
02:03:57,109 --> 02:03:58,193
it.

1530
02:03:59,444 --> 02:04:00,571
It's him.

1531
02:04:00,988 --> 02:04:04,283
What? You made him sound
like this terrifying figure.

1532
02:04:05,951 --> 02:04:07,035
He is.
