1
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,740
Papochka?

2
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,611
Papa!

3
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,533
My kiss.

4
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,319
Mmm.

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,149
I told you to go
straight from school,

6
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:04,064
not all the way home.

7
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,239
The roads are dangerous.

8
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:08,111
But I, uh... Forget your dress, yes.

9
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:10,243
Come.

10
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,190
Mom's wedding ring.

11
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,710
The only other woman who's ever
accompanied me was your mother.

12
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:44,060
You're old enough.

13
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,541
I thought you should
wear something of hers.

14
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,949
Your uncle is downstairs.

15
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:06,648
Wear your dress.

16
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,348
Oh, my God.

17
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:30,628
No!

18
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,502
Run!

19
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,177
Jonna!

20
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:01,703
Jonna!

21
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:08,144
Jonna.

22
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,798
Go! Go!
Find my brother!

23
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:11,539
Jonna!

24
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,583
This is Luka Lesek.

25
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:59,848
He runs the largest human trafficking
operation in all of Eastern Europe.

26
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,075
It's women and children mostly.

27
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:13,427
Used for forced labor,
prostitution, and so on.

28
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,039
And he runs the local police,
of course, with kickbacks.

29
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,179
Oh! And did I tell you?

30
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:29,530
Just around the corner
from where you are now,

31
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:33,229
the most marvelous bar.

32
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,753
I don't know what it's
like now, but in the '90s,

33
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:39,975
the most beautiful women
in all of Eastern Europe.

34
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,847
You love the sound of your
own voice, don't you, old man?

35
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:46,721
Oh, Morgan, dear boy,
I'm just trying to help.

36
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,723
You know, there's more
to life than just...

37
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:53,162
You know, I'd love to take the travel
tips from an aging Lothario like yourself,

38
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,991
but now really is not the time.

39
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:57,688
All right, well,
I'll leave you to it.

40
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:00,561
And do me a favor.

41
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:03,781
Try not to reduce the splendid
city of Ljubljana to rubble. Hmm?

42
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,783
I can't make any promises.

43
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:06,828
Travel safe.

44
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,751
"Nor dread nor hope
attend a dying animal

45
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,276
"A man awaits his end

46
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,410
"Dreading and hoping all."

47
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,598
Fuck!

48
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:54,484
Where are you, bastard?

49
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:10,239
Fuck.

50
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:22,898
Come on.

51
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,985
God!

52
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,751
I'm glad I got you, Morgan.
Tell me all about it.

53
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:23,475
Well, to say it didn't go
well would be a slight understatement.

54
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,217
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Care to explain?

55
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:28,480
Digging a bullet
out of my body, but...

56
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,443
Somebody shot me
as I targeted Lesek.

57
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,967
Oh, you know, a little
flesh wound here and there,

58
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,851
that's pretty much
part of the job description.

59
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:41,929
It felt calculated.
Professional.

60
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:43,670
I think there was
a third party involved.

61
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:45,976
Another shooter, eh?

62
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,153
Well, thank God you're alive.
What about Lesek?

63
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:52,504
The guy who shot me shot him.

64
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,638
Clearly not too selective.

65
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,988
Right. Well, I'll dig around,
and see what I can find out.

66
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,774
Oh! Another thing.

67
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:03,559
There's a new job,
came in after you left.

68
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,955
I think it's about time that we let
some young guns take over, buddy.

69
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,567
People who don't mind
getting shot.

70
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,742
No, no, no, no.

71
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,788
Morgan, this isn't something
we just pass up.

72
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,093
This is big.

73
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:18,835
So travel safe.

74
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,799
We'll talk about it when
you get back, all right?

75
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,866
Oh, my day just got better.

76
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,910
Are you hurt?

77
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, no.

78
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:55,785
Just tired.
Really long day.

79
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,266
I can hear it.
Video, please.

80
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,052
The signal's
not that great, babe.

81
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,924
I don't think
I'm gonna get picture up.

82
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,317
Come on.
I miss seeing you.

83
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:09,190
I don't sleep well when you're
not here, and you know that.

84
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,974
I think you tie
that robe too tight.

85
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:13,020
Do I?

86
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,675
So maybe I should loosen it?

87
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,896
That does feel better.

88
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:24,858
Oh, sorry.
Connection's bad.

89
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,991
That's just cruel.

90
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:30,777
Look, I got to, uh...
I gotta go.

91
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,648
You got a plane to catch?

92
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,519
Good. Love you.

93
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,086
I miss you.

94
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,613
Oh, God.

95
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:06,943
Merci.

96
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:15,822
The attack culminated
in the demise of Luka Lesek,

97
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,389
leader of
the Ljubljana crime ring.

98
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:22,480
A rival syndicate? Perhaps.
A personal feud? It's possible.

99
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:26,267
But if you look at the autopsy
reports, it will indicate otherwise.

100
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,878
Clearly this was done
by a trained hand.

101
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,968
If we look at the wounds here,
they're way too precise

102
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,754
for what we expect
from a typical gang war.

103
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:39,236
The bullet's entry
and its pinpoint accuracy

104
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,717
would suggest an assassination.

105
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,894
Personal belief, a contract
killer with a military background.

106
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:48,680
Our best option at the moment is
to work with the local authorities.

107
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:51,858
So, ladies and gentlemen,
let's get to work.

108
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,033
We got a lot to do.

109
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,035
Thank you.

110
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:26,066
What's been happening in
the world today?

111
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,035
Mmm.

112
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,257
What are you up to?
Some no good?

113
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:52,048
Graffiti. Okay.

114
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:54,311
Well, you gotta
practice more, buddy.

115
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,320
How about you?

116
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,541
Come on. I know
you're a good person.

117
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,415
Buy him some water or something.

118
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:14,505
Oh.

119
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:17,900
There we go.

120
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:20,033
There are still some good
people in this world.

121
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,226
Ciao.

122
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:55,720
There she is.

123
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:56,852
I missed you.

124
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,941
It's so good to see you.

125
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,772
Got you something though.Mmm.

126
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:04,860
Mmm-hmm.

127
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,777
Huh?

128
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,258
This one looks like
it's had a rough life.

129
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,782
Like you wouldn't believe.

130
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:16,785
One of these days you're gonna
let me get you something nice.

131
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:18,047
I prefer this.

132
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:23,009
Let's go home. I'll get you more of them.

133
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:42,942
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

134
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,381
It's so good to have you back.

135
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,997
Hi.Hi.

136
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,489
What's this? Oh, it's nothing.

137
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:11,144
It's just a scratch.
You know how clumsy I am.

138
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:20,022
What the fuck, Morgan?

139
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,722
What's this?

140
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:28,465
I didn't want to tell you, but I
know how much you hate motorcycles.

141
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,381
One of the guys had one.

142
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:34,471
Next thing I know,
I'm upside down in a ditch.

143
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,256
I'm sorry.
But it's nothing.

144
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,127
It's fine. It's not fine.

145
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:41,609
Every time you go away,
bruises, cuts, scratches...

146
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,567
Now this?

147
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:46,092
I'm here now, aren't I?
And what about tomorrow?

148
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,398
Tomorrow I'm gonna be here, too.

149
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:51,619
And the next day and the next
day and the day after that.

150
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,448
You can't get rid of me
that easy.

151
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,669
Promise.

152
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,108
If you can keep me down,
sure, I'll promise.

153
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,545
I will. Yeah?

154
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,294
Shit!

155
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:15,686
Are you okay? I'm fine.

156
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,733
Just double broken ribs,
but okay.

157
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:52,593
The instructions
were very clear.

158
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:55,030
Yeah, and I told you I'm out.

159
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,773
Morgan, it was a close thing.
I understand.

160
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:00,427
And you faced
your own mortality.

161
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,342
Yes.

162
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:05,606
But look, it was an off day.
We all have off days.

163
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:06,998
Ah.

164
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,957
Gyoza.
They're very good.

165
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,091
I don't think you're listening to me.
I'm out.

166
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,442
I'm out, too.

167
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:18,358
Of soy sauce.

168
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,273
Waiter!

169
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:22,362
You're insufferable. Oh, Morgan,
sit down. Come on.

170
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,668
Don't be... Don't be so dramatic.
Come on.

171
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:28,629
It's not that simple.

172
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:31,588
The client specifically
requested you.

173
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,634
Why?

174
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:35,070
Because of
your boyish good looks,

175
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,593
your devilish charm.
Who knows?

176
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:39,118
Or maybe they're just fans of your work.
It doesn't matter.

177
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:42,251
The thing is, it's not one job.

178
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:46,168
It's six.
Six separate contracts.

179
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:49,389
And each one
pays a million dollars.

180
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:53,044
Now, that money
would set you up for life.

181
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:56,265
What kind of life
would that be? Whatever you want it to be.

182
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:59,616
It's $6 million.

183
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,750
I don't know if you're familiar
with that sort of concept,

184
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:06,493
but that can buy you an awful
lot of bottles of Pinot Noir.

185
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:09,017
We're doing good work.

186
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,801
Good? Necessary work.

187
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:12,368
These are evil men.

188
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:14,457
Now, I know they're supposed
to pay for their sins

189
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,545
in the next life.

190
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,505
But why wait for that, hmm?

191
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:21,595
I don't know.
This last job...

192
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:24,467
I know, but you survived.

193
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:26,904
And you know why?'Cause that's what
you trained me to do.

194
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,037
This is what you're meant to do.

195
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,434
Now, these six contracts...

196
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,697
Remember when we first
started working together?

197
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,133
I was just a kid.

198
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,702
I had no plan,
no connections, no clue.

199
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:45,184
Now I've...
I've had my time. Okay.

200
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,795
There comes a point when you
need to understand when to quit.

201
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:50,754
When you're still able to wake up
in the morning and enjoy a sunrise.

202
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,410
I fucking love my sunrises,
Caldwell. I really do.

203
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,456
So if you want that money
bad enough,

204
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,579
you're gonna have to squeeze
those triggers yourself.

205
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:02,026
What's this about,
Morgan? Hmm?

206
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,639
There's three reasons
why people like us stop.

207
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:09,295
The first one is we find God.

208
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:12,907
Now, in your case, I think
that's extremely unlikely.

209
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,694
The second one is, and I do
hope it's not this, a woman.

210
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:21,524
Now, that's never
a good enough reason.

211
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:23,483
Trust me, I know.

212
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,181
And the third one... We're dead.

213
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,530
Yes, we die.

214
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:28,792
But not you, Morgan.

215
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:30,490
No, not you.

216
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,275
Now...

217
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,714
Gyoza?

218
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:39,238
Come on.
They're really very good.

219
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:44,504
I fucking hate you sometimes.
You know that?

220
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:55,254
Oh, my God. The amount of
things they put in mayonnaise.

221
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:59,345
Yeah, grab that pasta.
It's my favorite.

222
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,391
This is my corner right here.

223
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,744
My favorite cereal.

224
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:10,094
It's got a secret
decoder ring inside.

225
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,272
There is no prize.
Come on.

226
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,988
Well, they wouldn't put it
on the front of the box.

227
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:18,320
I mean, that defeats the
object of it being a secret.

228
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,409
Besides, I'm gonna use it
to figure things out.

229
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:23,630
Like why you deserve me?

230
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:26,372
Well, I know the answer to that already.
That's easy.

231
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:28,939
I don't.

232
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:31,507
Oh!

233
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:34,031
For the kids. Too much sugar.

234
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:36,077
Maybe something else.
Keep them for myself then.

235
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,431
Oh!

236
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,303
It's fate.

237
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,175
Our first pet. It's a plant.

238
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:49,458
Well, yeah, but you still gotta
feed it and things, right?

239
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:51,614
Water it. Take it out.

240
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:54,835
Like for walks
and things? Sure. Why not?

241
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:57,707
Your responsibility.

242
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,064
Think it will be us one day?

243
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,113
I bet they're out here
every single night.

244
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:15,116
Watch.

245
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,945
He's gonna take his jacket off
and put it around her shoulders.

246
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:25,561
And then she's gonna
grab his hand again.

247
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:30,697
Wow!

248
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,264
Four years, and I still
don't know how you do that.

249
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:37,660
You just have to predict.
All the threads are there.

250
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:41,360
You just piece them together
and figure it out, I guess.

251
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:44,283
What do you think
about that couple?

252
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:52,675
I think he looks more interested in
the girl with the white boots than her.

253
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,416
Yeah.
And she knows it.

254
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,766
But she won't say she's upset.

255
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,334
Well, her body language
will give it away.

256
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,293
She's either gonna look
away or fold her arms.

257
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:09,039
So you always know
what I'm gonna do next?

258
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:12,869
No.

259
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:22,705
You should come home with me.

260
00:23:25,534 --> 00:23:29,277
My parents are tired of only
hearing stories about you.

261
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:35,109
Handsome, smart, kind,
photojournalist.

262
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:37,285
They think I made you up.

263
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:38,852
It does sound like
you did make me up.

264
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,426
What do you think
about this guy on our left?

265
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,607
He's wondering why you're
avoiding the subject.

266
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,133
Okay, I'll come home with you.

267
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:01,657
Hmm! Hmm?

268
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,877
Aren't you full of
surprises these days?

269
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:08,534
And you know what?
You're not the only one.

270
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:11,841
Oh, so you have
some surprises, too.Maybe.

271
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,801
And before you ask, it's
not about my art program.

272
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,472
Somebody help me!

273
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,680
What are you doing?

274
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:41,278
You're photographing him?

275
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:52,986
It's all right. It's over.
You're safe. Okay?

276
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:54,161
We need to call the police.

277
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,684
We can't just... We gotta go, Sophie.

278
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:04,606
You just killed a man.

279
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:09,350
Left his body in the park.

280
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,743
We need to call the police.

281
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,571
It was self-defense.
I'll tell them you...

282
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:13,615
Don't touch me.

283
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:19,055
The things you did to him.

284
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:22,493
How were you able to? You
searched his body for what?

285
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:24,365
For an ID.

286
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:26,628
For foreign currency.
Some sort of lead.

287
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,587
You know, I need to
find out who he was.

288
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:34,114
Was he after you?

289
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,725
So this wasn't any kind
of robbery or...

290
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:38,684
Morgan, answer me.

291
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:40,337
I don't have the answers.

292
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:45,125
All I know is that
you are not safe with me.

293
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:46,778
I just need time.

294
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:53,437
Give me time.

295
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:57,528
Show me the contracts.

296
00:26:57,572 --> 00:27:00,706
I want to see the goddamn
contracts, Caldwell.

297
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:03,360
Show me the fucking files
or you're going to be the job!

298
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:06,799
This is the second time this week that
there's been a targeted hit on me.

299
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:07,974
I want to know why.

300
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:13,588
The timing of those contracts
isn't a fucking coincidence!

301
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,952
Well, I'll do some digging around.
See what I can find out.

302
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:39,875
Who are they?

303
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,877
Oh, Christ.
Don't you ever knock? Who are they?

304
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:44,769
You know, there are certain civilities
when you enter a chap's place, you know?

305
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,055
The man who tried to kill me.

306
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:53,672
Well, composition's nice.

307
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,761
Subject matter's
a touch macabre.

308
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:58,938
Find out who he is
and who sent him.

309
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:00,461
Oh, I can tell you who he is.

310
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:04,421
His name's Alec Drakos.

311
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:10,210
Greek national, special ops,
couple of tours of Afghanistan,

312
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:12,603
became a mercenary,
ultimately a gun for hire.

313
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:15,911
And I bet he's the chap
that shot you in Slovenia.

314
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:18,261
Look at this.
Better days.

315
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:21,917
Now, on the plus side,

316
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:25,181
a million dollars will
be wired to your account.

317
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:26,922
Plus my usual fee.

318
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:29,925
And, um, I will take care
of the finger business.

319
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:33,712
Mr. Rossi, who has a liberal
view when it comes to bribery.

320
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:37,280
Caldwell, what the fuck
are you talking about?

321
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:38,934
Right. I forgot
to tell you.

322
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:42,198
Each kill must be confirmed
by the receipt of a finger

323
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:45,114
to a postal box in Paris.

324
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,074
So, listen to me.

325
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:50,946
You are in now.

326
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:53,296
I have accepted the job.

327
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,515
I didn't accept anything.

328
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,952
Drakos was one of
your contracts.

329
00:28:56,996 --> 00:28:59,694
Good result.
Only five to go.

330
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:04,525
Humor me.
Who are the others?

331
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:06,440
Who are the others?

332
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:09,312
Oh, you know,
the worst of the worst.

333
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:12,751
Backgrounds in espionage in the
military, and crime, of course.

334
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,448
What's the thread?

335
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,755
What do they have
in common? Hmm. Which is?

336
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,497
Their occupation.

337
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,630
They are assassins,
Morgan, like you.

338
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:27,896
Just let me get this right.

339
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:31,987
I've been hired
to assassinate assassins.

340
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,773
And they've been hired
to kill me.

341
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:37,166
And each other.

342
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,691
Fact is, Morgan,
they were coming for you,

343
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,606
whether you accepted or not.

344
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,001
But, on the plus side, same
odds, even playing field.

345
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:48,874
This isn't
a fucking game! Oh, yes, it is.

346
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:51,615
To the person who set
this up, this is a game.

347
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,228
And if you want to live,
you have to play.

348
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:57,186
Here.

349
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:02,191
Morgan, you've got this.

350
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:17,206
Anselm Ryder.

351
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,078
No! No!

352
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:20,644
A ruthless psychopath.

353
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:23,430
Signature move, collect
a finger from the victim.

354
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:24,953
A souvenir of sorts.

355
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:27,956
Pablo Martinez.

356
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:35,137
Mr. Martinez is a poisoner.

357
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,842
Yuko.

358
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:47,584
Yuko is deadly with blades,

359
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:50,936
and in close combat.

360
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,600
The charming Demir
is an opportunistic sociopath.

361
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:07,778
He's locked up in a maximum
security prison in Bosnia.

362
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:10,781
Finding him is simple,
but access will be tricky.

363
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:14,655
Falk.

364
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:17,745
Now, Falk is a legend
and problematic.

365
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:21,183
No positive ID, no photos,
no patterns.

366
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,973
Just a trail of bodies
and cover ups

367
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:30,627
that are only possible
if Falk's working

368
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,847
from within
the intelligence community.

369
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:38,809
Now, each kill must be confirmed
by the receipt of a finger

370
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:40,724
to a postal box in Paris.

371
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,247
Demir. Who are you?

372
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,511
What do you want?

373
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,861
Good news.

374
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,472
You're being released today.

375
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:08,133
Pierre, I have a gift for you.

376
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:09,438
Thanks, Inspector Leon.

377
00:34:34,202 --> 00:34:35,919
Welcome, Inspector Leon.

378
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,423
Taking precautions, I see.

379
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:39,077
Aren't you?

380
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,514
Hmm.

381
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:44,778
Maat.
The Egyptian goddess...

382
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:45,866
Of justice.

383
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,913
My reminder to stay focused.

384
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:53,961
Hmm.

385
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:59,140
A penthouse in an empty
building in Paris.

386
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,011
How did you manage...
I bought the building.

387
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:04,406
Drink?

388
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:09,107
And when we say drink,
we mean vodka.

389
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,632
Uh, I'm on duty.

390
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:17,680
Don't trust a man
who won't drink with you.

391
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:20,596
That's what
my uncle Mariusz says.

392
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:24,600
But consider the source.

393
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:31,085
One assassin's been killed.

394
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:34,610
Alec Drakos.

395
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:36,134
The responding officer's
bodycam.

396
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:43,532
How did you get this?

397
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:45,795
I hacked the video server
of the Rome police.

398
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:47,971
Who killed him?

399
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:49,886
We don't know.

400
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:53,977
What about the others? Still searching.

401
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,938
These are very skilled people.

402
00:35:57,981 --> 00:36:01,855
Aliases, no digital traces.
They avoid all patterns.

403
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:05,554
I handed you detailed files
on all of them, didn't I?

404
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,991
So stop telling me
things I know,

405
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,950
and start telling me
things I don't.

406
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,171
Six million dollars.

407
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:16,130
Your boss said that would
lure them out.

408
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,959
Now where are they? Her plan takes time.

409
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,138
And you're not the only one
who needs to protect his back.

410
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,401
One mistake... Then don't make any.

411
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:28,925
Na zdarovya.

412
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:11,490
Wake up.

413
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:17,669
Where am I?

414
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,368
You received a package.

415
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,718
Box number 115. What
do you know about it?

416
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:23,850
Who the fuck are you?

417
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,157
We're gonna play
a very short game.

418
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:29,595
You don't answer my questions,
or you tell me some lies,

419
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:31,249
I'll blow your damn brains out.

420
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:35,731
Who are you
and who do you work for?

421
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:39,648
Answer me! My name is Leon.

422
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:42,477
Inspector, French police.

423
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:47,003
A finger arrives along with the name
of the person it was attached to.

424
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:50,529
We publish a fake obituary
in Le Monde

425
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:54,359
just to confirm receipt.

426
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,231
Within a few days,

427
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,366
we receive a file detailing every single
assassination this person committed,

428
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:05,457
and then we open
investigations into them.

429
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,675
How were you first contacted?

430
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:11,114
Email, anonymous, untraceable.

431
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:13,291
We simply followed
the directions

432
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,598
and posted
the first fake obituary

433
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:19,340
just to say yes.

434
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,475
Under what name? Maat.

435
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,566
Maat?
What is that?

436
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:39,099
Maat. We found it was an Egyptian
goddess of truth and justice.

437
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:43,146
She set the order of the universe
right after the chaos of its creation.

438
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:48,674
And? And she weighs
the hearts of the dead

439
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:53,505
just to see if they're too heavy
with evil to reach paradise.

440
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,985
What significance
is that to you?

441
00:38:56,029 --> 00:39:00,294
I believe the message in
the name is perhaps for you,

442
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:02,949
no?

443
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:46,987
Morgan Gaines.

444
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:54,974
We're alive,
but not quite living.

445
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:57,237
Dead,

446
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,720
but not yet in the grave.

447
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:04,897
Stuck in this half-life,
until it ends.

448
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,160
When is that?

449
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:12,687
Do you really think the last
surviving assassin will just be

450
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,647
free to enjoy
his newfound riches?

451
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:21,304
No, he'll be hunted down, too.

452
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,439
Unless...

453
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:30,052
Unless we help each other find the
person who's holding our strings.

454
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:33,273
The puppet master we're
all dancing to now, and,

455
00:41:34,274 --> 00:41:35,275
and,

456
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:39,975
kill him.

457
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:43,892
Performance wasn't bad. How
long did you practice that for?

458
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:46,634
Hmm. He speaks.

459
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:50,420
Mr. Gaines.

460
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:54,729
It's in our mutual interest
to communicate.

461
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:57,210
Collaborate.

462
00:41:57,253 --> 00:41:59,342
We should share what we know.

463
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:01,083
Why don't you share first?

464
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:02,781
Oh, I'm happy to.

465
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:04,585
Just give me an address and a
time you'll be there, and I'll...

466
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:06,567
I'll tell you in person.

467
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,569
Hmm. We can
share electronically.

468
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,051
Okey-dokey, sweetie.

469
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:14,532
But you're taking
all the fun out of it.

470
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:24,193
He bled out like a pig.

471
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,936
Sure smelled like one, too.

472
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,900
So how about you send me
a photo of yourself now?

473
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:31,679
Mmm.

474
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:34,812
No.

475
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:39,469
But I'm sure you smell
better than poor Demir.

476
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:45,911
Not gonna let you bleed out.

477
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:48,304
I wanna see you try.

478
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:51,917
We'll see out of the both
of us who bleeds out first.

479
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,225
"Great man and his pride
confronting murderous men."

480
00:42:57,226 --> 00:42:59,359
A great man.

481
00:42:59,402 --> 00:43:00,708
As military snipers,

482
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:06,018
we were taught
when we lock onto a target,

483
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,236
to whisper to ourselves,

484
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:09,543
steady our breathing,

485
00:43:11,066 --> 00:43:13,155
release all consequence,

486
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,071
and then squeeze the trigger.

487
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:19,031
I used to recite this poem
Death by William Butler Yeats.

488
00:43:21,773 --> 00:43:23,601
Catchy title.

489
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,515
I think we're being told
something here.

490
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:29,389
The money was most likely
put up by a client

491
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:31,913
who had hired
all of us in the past.

492
00:43:31,957 --> 00:43:33,611
We're from different countries.

493
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:37,353
Our hits spread
all over the world.

494
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:38,616
Exactly.

495
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,661
We took out our marks
using different methods.

496
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:44,099
I mean, nothing would point to one
person doing all of these hits.

497
00:43:44,143 --> 00:43:46,885
Now he wants to silence us.

498
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:51,019
Maybe. But why not just hire
one of us to kill us all?

499
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:52,847
Why now?

500
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:56,634
Why go after assassins
that aren't active?

501
00:43:58,505 --> 00:43:59,506
Demir.

502
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:03,945
He'd been in prison
for the last four years.

503
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:06,731
I think they're trying
to make a point.

504
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:10,256
We're meant to feel the
consequences of what we've done.

505
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,736
What it's like to be targeted.

506
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:16,696
Here's my number.

507
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:19,265
It's a secure line.

508
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:21,093
We make a great team.

509
00:44:21,136 --> 00:44:25,706
Oh, in fact, um, here's
a little parting gift for you.

510
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,795
It's Pablo Martinez's location.

511
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:29,579
Bye, Morgan.

512
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:41,896
Oh, I can tell you who he is.

513
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,637
His name's Alec Drakos.

514
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,207
Special ops, couple tours of
Afghanistan, Greek national.

515
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,862
They are assassins,
Morgan, like you.

516
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:19,934
Oh, Christ! Not again.

517
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:22,502
What would be so terribly
wrong with ringing the buzzer?

518
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:24,983
When I was targeting
Lesek in Slovenia,

519
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:27,681
you knew those six contracts
were already running, didn't you?

520
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,683
My computer was hacked.
Was that you?

521
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,598
Your phone records
show that you called

522
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:34,993
Alec Drakos in Slovenia
after you spoke to me.

523
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:37,212
Again in Turino.

524
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,998
You lied about his profile.

525
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:43,175
He was ex-Royal Marines,
like me.

526
00:45:43,218 --> 00:45:47,179
Sniper recon division,
just like me.

527
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:50,269
No friends, no family,
grew up in foster care.

528
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:52,010
Like me.

529
00:45:53,446 --> 00:45:55,665
You lied about everything.

530
00:45:57,493 --> 00:45:59,234
I think you've got this
terribly wrong.

531
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:02,542
You were his handler, too.

532
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:06,241
You fed him his intel.

533
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:08,243
You told him he could
pick up the Lesek contract

534
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:10,202
if he got rid of me first,
didn't you?

535
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:13,379
Morgan, this only works
if we completely...

536
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:15,729
You told him my location.

537
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,166
You sent him to fucking kill me!

538
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:22,388
Bullet came this close
to my head!

539
00:46:22,431 --> 00:46:24,042
This close to Sophie's head.

540
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:30,788
Bring back memories?

541
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:33,355
"Better days," as you put it?

542
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:41,711
Morgan, calm down.

543
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:45,063
Okay, Drakos worked
for me as well.

544
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:48,544
But it was the game that set
you up against each other.

545
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:51,460
There was no other way.

546
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:55,116
And choosing between you, it's like
choosing between your children.

547
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,335
But you did choose.

548
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:58,685
And you chose him.

549
00:46:58,728 --> 00:47:01,166
No, listen to me.
Listen to me.

550
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:04,996
Of course I set this up between you.
I had to. There was no choice.

551
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,216
But I did so in the full
and certain knowledge

552
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,652
that you would win.

553
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:12,351
You were never going
to lose to Drakos.

554
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:15,223
You're the best, Morgan.
You're the gold standard.

555
00:47:15,267 --> 00:47:16,268
Bullshit.

556
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:20,794
Was it always about
the money for you?

557
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,710
Did any of my kills
actually deserve it?

558
00:47:23,753 --> 00:47:25,364
All of them.
Each one.

559
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:31,587
Once you see the lies,
you see the liar, too.

560
00:47:34,068 --> 00:47:36,766
The number to my burner
phone that only you knew

561
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,987
was compromised by Falk.

562
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,033
I gave her nothing. Her?

563
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:44,557
So you're saying you
actually know this woman.

564
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,125
Your arrogance made you
careless, you traitor.

565
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:49,823
She knows who you are.

566
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:53,348
She broke into your records
just as I did.

567
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:56,917
Up until now,

568
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:01,052
it's just been the means
to get close to me.

569
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:07,362
But once she runs out of her patience,
she's gonna come looking for you,

570
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:09,887
and have much more
of a hands-on approach.

571
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:12,367
Huh?

572
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:14,630
You're gonna wish I put a
fucking bullet in your head.

573
00:48:16,284 --> 00:48:18,808
Morgan, I'm sorry.

574
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:23,901
Listen, you can do this.

575
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,555
We can do this. We've been
through so much together.

576
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:31,691
You were like a father to me.

577
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:36,391
I taught you everything I know.

578
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,047
There's nothing fucking left.

579
00:48:44,617 --> 00:48:45,792
Welcome to the game.

580
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:26,267
Mr. Gaines.

581
00:49:26,311 --> 00:49:29,662
Tell me about your end,
$6 million for the contracts.

582
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:41,891
Their money is in an offshore
account that traces to Kyiv, Ukraine.

583
00:49:41,935 --> 00:49:45,939
Now, if look at all our hits tied to
Kyiv, you will find a common theme.

584
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:50,117
They are all linked
to gas pipelines.

585
00:49:50,161 --> 00:49:52,554
Which is
a billion-dollar industry.

586
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:56,471
Mariusz Ilych.

587
00:49:56,515 --> 00:50:00,214
His company has been awarded every major
construction project for the past decade,

588
00:50:00,258 --> 00:50:02,434
because we got rid of
anyone standing in his way.

589
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:04,827
Including his
own brother, Yakov.

590
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:07,178
Now he considers us loose ends.

591
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:12,096
Maybe his niece Jonna
discovered what her uncle did.

592
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:17,971
Now, if she traced her uncle's
payments to all of us...

593
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,321
But didn't know which
assassin killed her daddy.

594
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:27,502
She could have set us up
against each other.

595
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:20,773
Pablo Martinez,
a bit of an anomaly.

596
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:23,123
Never uses a gun,
prefers poison.

597
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,133
"Nor dread nor hope
attend a dying animal..."

598
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,788
No kills for 10 years.
Disappeared after that.

599
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:37,181
Been off the grid ever since.

600
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:38,660
"A man awaits his end

601
00:51:40,445 --> 00:51:42,882
"Dreading and hoping all..."

602
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:44,927
He's a lone wolf. No wife.

603
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:47,495
"Many times he died..." CALDWELL: No kids.

604
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:49,149
"Many times he rose again..."

605
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:53,849
Oh, my God! Yes!

606
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:54,937
Give me a kiss.

607
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:58,115
Okay. Now you can
come with me. But, I...

608
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,205
Fuck.

609
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:19,397
Drop the ax.

610
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,094
Drop the fucking ax!
Turn around.

611
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:23,488
Slowly.

612
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,709
Easy.

613
00:52:27,753 --> 00:52:29,624
That girl in there.
Is that your daughter?

614
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:35,587
Where's the mother? Breast cancer.
Two years ago.

615
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,676
Just the two of you here, alone?

616
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,199
Take anything.

617
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:42,115
Do whatever you want to me.

618
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:47,164
But my daughter, she's only four.
Please.

619
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:48,774
Were you offered
contracts recently?

620
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,214
Answer the fucking question.

621
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:56,260
I don't know what it is.
I don't know.

622
00:52:57,565 --> 00:52:59,698
Tell me what date it is today.

623
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:04,268
Today? May, the 5th.

624
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:06,139
You kill people for a living.

625
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,924
I know exactly who you are. So
you don't fucking lie to me.

626
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:11,338
Otherwise, May the 5th is gonna
go down in your daughter's memory

627
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:13,581
as the last day she saw
her daddy alive.

628
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,496
I killed one person.

629
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:19,500
Eight years ago.

630
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:22,547
And the nightmares only left
me after my daughter was born.

631
00:53:23,852 --> 00:53:25,506
What about that job?
Tell me about it.

632
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,205
Daddy, you said 10
minutes for ice cream.

633
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:30,598
Yes, honey.
Daddy's coming.

634
00:53:34,515 --> 00:53:35,515
Please.

635
00:53:49,835 --> 00:53:52,359
Wanna color? I'm fine.

636
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:54,753
Maybe next picture.
I do a lot.

637
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:55,797
You do.

638
00:53:57,886 --> 00:53:59,236
Whichever cup you want.

639
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:07,505
Tell me about the last job of yours.
Where was it?

640
00:54:10,508 --> 00:54:11,508
In Prague.

641
00:54:13,728 --> 00:54:14,729
I botched it.

642
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:19,821
Slipped thallium sulfate
in his coffee.

643
00:54:21,432 --> 00:54:24,783
But the dosage was too weak.

644
00:54:27,176 --> 00:54:29,222
Hospital for 18 days.

645
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:31,180
His hair fell out.

646
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:35,968
He lost almost 100 pounds.

647
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:38,275
They cut a hole in his
throat to help him breathe.

648
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:43,105
I went to the hospital.

649
00:54:43,845 --> 00:54:45,107
Sat in the chapel.

650
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:47,849
I'm not sure if I was
praying for him or myself.

651
00:54:49,024 --> 00:54:50,591
After that, I disappeared.

652
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:53,725
I was done.

653
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,207
Daddy, why are you sad?

654
00:54:58,251 --> 00:54:59,296
No, honey.

655
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:04,997
Dad is just telling a sad story.

656
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,260
Okay?

657
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,742
You just give me as many
details as you remember.

658
00:55:10,785 --> 00:55:14,180
Somebody's pit us against each other.
I want to find out why and who.

659
00:55:15,486 --> 00:55:17,966
He must know you'll
come for him in the end.

660
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,317
Oh, yeah, you can bet on that.

661
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:29,326
Do you mind?

662
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,983
Blue's my favorite color,
but it's okay if you use it.

663
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:36,811
Thank you.

664
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:38,117
It's my favorite color, too.

665
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:40,815
Honey, do you want more milk?

666
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:43,470
Can I have
more milk, please? Yes.

667
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:50,042
You need to stay away
from the windows.

668
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:52,934
You might not have
received those contracts,

669
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:55,118
but there's still a million-dollar
bounty on your head.

670
00:56:04,796 --> 00:56:05,796
Do you have a gun?

671
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,668
I've got a home phone.

672
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:11,150
Less than 10 people
have the number.

673
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:15,894
And they all live
within 20 miles.

674
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:18,766
I don't use my real name.

675
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,990
I've gone as far
from my past as I can.

676
00:56:29,124 --> 00:56:32,389
Well, your past
has caught up with you.

677
00:56:33,825 --> 00:56:34,825
They're coming.

678
00:56:40,048 --> 00:56:41,049
Yuko.

679
00:56:43,182 --> 00:56:45,489
Yuko is a martial arts master

680
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:48,230
most feared for her blade work,

681
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:51,799
and she has perhaps some
lingering daddy issues.

682
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:05,465
Now, if her mark is a woman, she
makes a clean strike to her heart.

683
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:08,816
But, if it's a man, she
prefers to cut him open.

684
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:10,731
Evisceration.

685
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:27,444
Her only weakness, she
dresses very light, no armor.

686
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:31,535
So, if you can manage it,

687
00:57:31,578 --> 00:57:33,972
a single bullet to the chest
ought to put her to rest.

688
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,861
Are you okay?

689
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,517
What took you so long?

690
00:59:14,812 --> 00:59:15,812
Thank you.

691
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:21,819
It's for your own good.

692
00:59:26,214 --> 00:59:28,565
Daddy, Daddy,
what's happening? Oh...

693
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:29,957
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

694
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:34,092
One bullet, my ass.

695
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:42,012
Don't worry.

696
01:00:53,388 --> 01:00:54,389
Oh, shit.

697
01:00:57,262 --> 01:00:58,524
Death has come to call.

698
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:00,873
I'm afraid so.

699
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,400
It's been a long time since
I heard your voice, Falk.

700
01:01:05,444 --> 01:01:08,012
Or should I call
you Vicky? Don't call me that.

701
01:01:18,152 --> 01:01:20,764
Will my death be painful?

702
01:01:20,807 --> 01:01:23,767
It's a warm feeling,
like a soft blanket.

703
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:27,118
Just let it pass over
and you'll sleep.

704
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:28,597
How very kind.

705
01:01:29,424 --> 01:01:30,991
How long do I have?

706
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:32,776
Hmm.

707
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:33,907
About an hour.

708
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:37,215
The fact that
I'm not already dead

709
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:39,957
leads me to believe that you
need something else from me.

710
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
What is it?

711
01:01:43,395 --> 01:01:47,225
Morgan Gaines.
I want his file and mine.

712
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:50,141
You already have his file.
You hacked my computer.

713
01:01:50,184 --> 01:01:52,839
Well, I have the official file.

714
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:57,061
I want the personal.
The one that you keep.

715
01:01:58,323 --> 01:02:01,195
Vicky... Don't call me that.

716
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:04,590
You seem to forget I'm dying.
Why should I give you anything?

717
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:05,722
Because of this.

718
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:10,117
The antidote.

719
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:12,641
I don't believe that
for a second.

720
01:02:12,685 --> 01:02:15,166
Believe it or not, I don't care.

721
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:17,298
But if you want to live...

722
01:02:21,476 --> 01:02:23,076
All right, well,
let me think about this.

723
01:02:25,132 --> 01:02:29,223
Meantime, I think I'll
fix myself a drink and...

724
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:32,313
Perhaps you'd like to join me.
We could have a good chat.

725
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:47,459
Please sit.

726
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:49,548
Sit down.

727
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:50,984
Ah.

728
01:02:52,507 --> 01:02:55,032
You'll take that seat.
Sit right here.

729
01:02:56,294 --> 01:02:57,295
As you wish.

730
01:03:07,566 --> 01:03:09,046
Hmm.

731
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:11,265
You can't blame me for trying.

732
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:14,442
I don't blame you. I don't
blame you for anything.

733
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:17,315
The past is the past.

734
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:25,279
Now, give me what I need.

735
01:04:08,714 --> 01:04:13,545
So, here it is.
Your file, encrypted.

736
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:16,069
Who else has seen this?

737
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:18,071
No one.

738
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:19,159
Not even Morgan?

739
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:21,509
No.

740
01:04:21,553 --> 01:04:25,600
As far as he's concerned,
you're an enigma and a mystery.

741
01:04:29,996 --> 01:04:31,041
Gone.

742
01:04:31,084 --> 01:04:32,084
Now...

743
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:35,306
Morgan, please.

744
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:03,029
This girl, this woman...

745
01:05:04,813 --> 01:05:08,774
She is bright.
She is kind.

746
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:12,125
And she knows nothing,
and she's nothing to you.

747
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:13,387
Oh.

748
01:05:13,431 --> 01:05:17,043
So, um, I should let her live?

749
01:05:20,177 --> 01:05:21,830
Mmm.

750
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:24,398
A little bit
sentimental for you.

751
01:05:24,442 --> 01:05:25,660
I'm dying, Falk.

752
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:30,100
Dying can bring out
the sentimental in a man.

753
01:05:34,626 --> 01:05:38,760
Morgan was my protege
just as you were.

754
01:05:38,804 --> 01:05:42,373
And whatever you think,
I'm not gonna betray him.

755
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:48,031
You betrayed him before.

756
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:50,642
Not this time.

757
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:53,166
So, if you don't mind,

758
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:56,169
you might just let an old man
rest his tired eyes,

759
01:05:57,823 --> 01:05:59,738
and enjoy what's left
of the evening.

760
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:01,522
Hmm.

761
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:05,178
Have it your way, old man.

762
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:36,862
Look what you did.

763
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,082
You...

764
01:06:41,606 --> 01:06:46,480
just lost the privilege
of a peaceful death.

765
01:07:12,158 --> 01:07:13,158
Pick up, Caldwell.

766
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:29,986
Can I speak to,
uh, SignorChivasso, please?

767
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,701
Who's this?

768
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:53,330
Morgan Gaines.

769
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:57,160
Mom killed at age four.
Dad gave you up.

770
01:07:57,203 --> 01:07:59,858
Foster care.
Kind of unpleasant.

771
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:02,010
I don't need my fucking history.
I've lived through it.

772
01:08:02,034 --> 01:08:06,778
Royal Marine sniper taken
under the wing of Ian Caldwell,

773
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:10,434
who offered you the chance to
kill evil men for your government.

774
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:14,655
Except it wasn't always
for your government,

775
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:16,092
and the men weren't always evil.

776
01:08:21,619 --> 01:08:22,968
You're a monster, Falk.

777
01:08:23,011 --> 01:08:25,362
Or should I call you Agent Vos?

778
01:08:26,406 --> 01:08:30,106
Well, Caldwell, that snake.

779
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:32,412
Did you know
that he lied to you?

780
01:08:32,456 --> 01:08:35,981
That he changed marks' background,
exaggerated their crimes,

781
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:38,201
omitted that they had children,
people that loved them.

782
01:08:38,244 --> 01:08:40,420
Just like I assumed
you loved your mom.

783
01:08:40,464 --> 01:08:42,161
Time's running out.

784
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:44,555
After I kill Ryder, you're next.

785
01:08:44,598 --> 01:08:49,299
Do you think that, um, Caldwell
was trying to ease your conscience?

786
01:08:49,342 --> 01:08:52,258
You think you're a good man,
don't you, Morgan?

787
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:55,261
You're just a slave
to your emotions.

788
01:08:55,305 --> 01:08:57,133
That's where we're different.

789
01:08:57,176 --> 01:08:59,483
'Cause I'm... I'm free.

790
01:08:59,526 --> 01:09:01,789
You want to get
to who's behind this or not?

791
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:04,705
My condolences,
by the way, for Caldwell.

792
01:09:04,749 --> 01:09:07,230
We all hope for a death
without suffering.

793
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:09,449
In his case,

794
01:09:09,493 --> 01:09:12,583
oh, it simply was impossible.

795
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:14,237
Such a shame though.

796
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,848
I want to believe that there's
at least one person honest.

797
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:19,155
Mmm-hmm.

798
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:22,375
Well, at least
you still have Sophie.

799
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:24,551
She's real cute.

800
01:09:24,595 --> 01:09:25,857
Ryder will take care of her.

801
01:09:29,774 --> 01:09:31,254
You got good taste.

802
01:09:36,302 --> 01:09:38,522
Grazie.

803
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:44,658
Ciao.

804
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:55,930
Hey, you,
I can't talk right now.

805
01:09:55,974 --> 01:09:58,324
Sophie, you need to do
exactly what I say.

806
01:09:58,368 --> 01:10:00,239
Can I call you back?
I was just...

807
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:02,783
There's someone coming for you.
You need to get to a safe house.

808
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:04,548
Get rid of your phone.
That can be tracked.

809
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:08,639
The address is 105 Via
Roma, apartment 42D.

810
01:10:08,682 --> 01:10:10,815
What do you mean
someone's coming for...

811
01:10:14,558 --> 01:10:15,646
Sophie!

812
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:18,562
Fuck!

813
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,240
There's an active
shooter at Arcabaleno School.

814
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:26,961
You need to hurry. Okay, we're on our way.

815
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:31,548
Sophie? Sophie!

816
01:11:33,637 --> 01:11:35,160
Are you hurt?

817
01:11:35,203 --> 01:11:37,118
Tell me what the fuck
is going on.

818
01:11:42,559 --> 01:11:45,039
Okay. You deserve
the truth.

819
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:52,003
When I was younger,
I joined the military.

820
01:11:52,046 --> 01:11:56,573
I thought it was a just cause, I
thought I was doing my part for society.

821
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:59,227
Well, it turns out there's a lot
of red tape behind saving lives.

822
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:05,233
I need to show you something.

823
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,209
After I left the Royal Marines,

824
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:29,345
I met a man named Caldwell.

825
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:33,087
He became like a mentor to me.

826
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:36,569
Introduced me to this world.

827
01:12:38,136 --> 01:12:40,356
He acted like a mediator
between clients.

828
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:43,359
These clients
wanted people dead.

829
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,451
Bad people.

830
01:12:48,494 --> 01:12:53,456
Murderers, rapists,
corrupt officials.

831
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,240
Over the years, I became numb.

832
01:12:56,763 --> 01:12:58,156
It all became meaningless.

833
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,463
Until you came into my life.

834
01:13:01,812 --> 01:13:03,074
You changed everything.

835
01:13:06,164 --> 01:13:07,426
You showed me a life

836
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:12,997
that I thought I didn't deserve.

837
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,739
Now I need to fight
to protect you.

838
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:17,393
Because I love you, Sophie.

839
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:20,657
I'm pregnant.

840
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:33,670
I leave tomorrow.

841
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:37,282
Go to my mother for a
few weeks in Lisbon.

842
01:13:37,325 --> 01:13:41,417
Then I'll be back
to my job, to my life.

843
01:13:43,114 --> 01:13:45,072
So whatever this is,
you make it stop.

844
01:13:54,081 --> 01:13:55,169
You leave tonight.

845
01:14:57,928 --> 01:14:58,972
So?

846
01:14:59,016 --> 01:15:00,016
There are two this time.

847
01:15:00,931 --> 01:15:01,932
Two from the same person?

848
01:15:01,975 --> 01:15:03,281
Mmm-mmm.

849
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:05,239
Nope there is a man's finger...

850
01:15:05,283 --> 01:15:06,284
and a woman's finger.

851
01:16:19,052 --> 01:16:20,619
What did you get
yourself into, old boy?

852
01:16:21,925 --> 01:16:24,318
Why is that you chose
the hard way out?

853
01:17:37,174 --> 01:17:38,175
Jesus Christ.

854
01:17:39,219 --> 01:17:40,743
Certainly wasn't loved as a kid.

855
01:18:22,349 --> 01:18:25,004
Everything clear, yeah?

856
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:28,268
We know who we're dealing with.
Shoot to kill.

857
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:30,922
Let's go!

858
01:18:33,578 --> 01:18:36,233
We just got confirmation
from the satellite footage.

859
01:18:36,276 --> 01:18:37,713
Ryder and Morgan are here.

860
01:18:37,756 --> 01:18:41,368
Don't worry, Jonna. The
nightmare stops today.

861
01:18:41,412 --> 01:18:43,066
We're gonna get him.Okay.

862
01:18:43,109 --> 01:18:44,349
I will take you to the airport.

863
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,461
Oui.

864
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,495
Laced with strychnine.

865
01:19:23,628 --> 01:19:26,674
Very fatal and extremely
fucking painful.

866
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:27,937
Why don't you take a seat?

867
01:19:38,295 --> 01:19:40,645
It's quite the collection
you have here.

868
01:19:40,688 --> 01:19:44,040
Somewhat of a signature
for you now, isn't it?

869
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:48,522
I bet if I dig deep enough, I'm
gonna find Yakov Ilych's finger.

870
01:19:48,566 --> 01:19:49,741
I don't know that person.

871
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:53,440
Don't fucking lie to me.

872
01:19:53,484 --> 01:19:56,182
Good thing about strychnine is
it doesn't fuck with your brain.

873
01:19:57,357 --> 01:19:59,098
So you're gonna know

874
01:19:59,142 --> 01:20:02,580
when every single muscle in your
body contracts simultaneously.

875
01:20:02,623 --> 01:20:06,018
The pain only intensifying with
the slightest of stimulation.

876
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:08,107
That's where I come in.

877
01:20:09,326 --> 01:20:10,675
Now give my fucking answers

878
01:20:10,718 --> 01:20:12,546
and I'll put you
out of your fucking misery!

879
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:15,158
Because she got
to you, too? Huh?

880
01:20:15,201 --> 01:20:18,814
Tell you it was in your
common interest...

881
01:20:19,423 --> 01:20:20,511
To collaborate?

882
01:20:28,127 --> 01:20:29,346
A little souvenir.

883
01:20:48,713 --> 01:20:49,953
Go, go, go, go, go!

884
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:08,650
Cover me! AGENT 2: Let's go!

885
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:12,868
Cover me!
Cover me! Cover me! AGENT 2: Quickly!

886
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:23,748
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Go!

887
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:25,837
He's here!

888
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,628
Captain! AGENT 2: Go, go, go, go!

889
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:47,772
Cover me!

890
01:21:48,729 --> 01:21:49,730
Captain!

891
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:55,040
- Go, go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

892
01:21:59,871 --> 01:22:00,872
He's here!

893
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,491
Go, go, go, go!

894
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:01,193
Get out of the car!

895
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:44,279
Go, go!

896
01:25:42,876 --> 01:25:46,053
It's over! Come
out of the car with your hands up!

897
01:26:11,209 --> 01:26:12,863
Move! Move! Move! Move!

898
01:26:17,084 --> 01:26:18,085
Where is he?

899
01:26:31,795 --> 01:26:32,926
Find his body.

900
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:38,193
Get me divers.Copy.

901
01:27:05,481 --> 01:27:08,155
Yes, the current from the river
should bring the body back to the south.

902
01:27:08,179 --> 01:27:10,007
Find me yet?
Or you need a hint?

903
01:27:12,009 --> 01:27:13,813
I'll call you back later.

904
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:16,076
The rules of that
little lying game we played,

905
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,362
you remember them, right?

906
01:27:17,406 --> 01:27:19,886
Is kidnapping me again
absolutely necessary?

907
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:23,325
Just send me
an email or call me.

908
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:27,154
The woman you're protecting, you
don't even know who the fuck she is.

909
01:27:27,198 --> 01:27:29,548
Agent Vos and Falk
are the same person.

910
01:27:29,592 --> 01:27:31,246
She's using you to kill people.

911
01:27:33,378 --> 01:27:35,075
All right, let's go.

912
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:37,339
I have a plan to stop her,
but we need to move now.

913
01:27:39,123 --> 01:27:41,212
You're going to help me
whether you like it or not.

914
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,215
Come on, Leon,
I know you're a good man.

915
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,260
Where would she be?

916
01:27:47,131 --> 01:27:49,742
Knowing her,
waiting for your body.

917
01:28:02,364 --> 01:28:04,409
Inspector Leon.

918
01:28:04,453 --> 01:28:06,585
Sorry to call you late.
We found his body.

919
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:07,673
Show me his face.

920
01:28:10,415 --> 01:28:12,069
Sorry to interrupt,

921
01:28:12,112 --> 01:28:14,114
Falk, Agent Vos,
whatever your name is.

922
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:16,465
Why don't you explain to
Leon who you really are?

923
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,253
What a disappointment you are.

924
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:02,554
Officer down. I need backup.
Request some backup now!

925
01:31:00,019 --> 01:31:02,326
The brigade
was alerted to the incident

926
01:31:02,369 --> 01:31:04,720
at around
12:30 a.m. local time.

927
01:31:04,763 --> 01:31:10,203
It's not clear whether the incident
was an accident or deliberate.

928
01:31:10,247 --> 01:31:14,556
Construction mogul Mariusz
Ilych wins parliament bid.

929
01:31:14,599 --> 01:31:17,123
The mogul's late brother,
Yakov Ilych,

930
01:31:17,167 --> 01:31:21,388
founded the gas production
empire before his untimely death.

931
01:31:21,432 --> 01:31:23,478
Yakov's daughter, Jonna Ilych,

932
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:26,263
supports her uncle, Mariusz,
in his campaign.

933
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:29,048
There will be a formal
celebration tomorrow in Prague.

934
01:31:42,714 --> 01:31:45,325
Thank you, Maxim. You
are done for today, you can go.

935
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:55,684
You forgot something?

936
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:57,773
Don't move.

937
01:31:57,816 --> 01:32:00,384
Nice to meet you, Jonna.
Or should I call you Maat?

938
01:32:03,343 --> 01:32:07,217
Maat? I
don't know this person.

939
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:09,001
Of course you do.

940
01:32:09,045 --> 01:32:11,308
You set up this game
for vengeance.

941
01:32:11,351 --> 01:32:14,180
But in fact, it was your
uncle who killed your father.

942
01:32:14,224 --> 01:32:18,054
No. He paid someone
like you to do that.

943
01:32:18,097 --> 01:32:21,666
Just like you paid a group
of us to kill each other.

944
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:24,147
Six million dollars
buys a lot of bodies.

945
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:26,366
I don't.

946
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:30,240
That money was to stop my
uncle, and to arrest all of you.

947
01:32:30,762 --> 01:32:31,762
Arrest us?

948
01:32:33,243 --> 01:32:34,723
How?

949
01:32:34,766 --> 01:32:37,769
My uncle kept me close
to control me.

950
01:32:37,813 --> 01:32:40,903
Made me part of the machine
helping him.

951
01:32:40,946 --> 01:32:46,299
A mass murderer seized power
over an entire country.

952
01:32:46,343 --> 01:32:49,389
He liked to parade me out.

953
01:32:49,433 --> 01:32:52,131
The poor orphan he saved.

954
01:32:52,175 --> 01:32:53,437
But if I questioned him,

955
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,700
he would have taken out
a contract on me, too.

956
01:32:55,744 --> 01:32:57,397
That's how he solved problems.

957
01:32:58,398 --> 01:33:00,183
I was helping them to end this.

958
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:03,882
Helping who? Agents.

959
01:33:04,491 --> 01:33:05,623
Which agents?

960
01:33:07,538 --> 01:33:10,541
Jonna Ilych?
Agent Vos.

961
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:13,022
I'm taking over
the investigation.

962
01:33:13,065 --> 01:33:16,460
Inspector Leon, you
report directly to me.

963
01:33:18,462 --> 01:33:19,506
Hmm.

964
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:24,207
So, um, is everything on here?

965
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:27,645
Yes. As much as I could gather on
my uncle's circle of assassins.

966
01:33:27,689 --> 01:33:30,300
Targets, money transfers.

967
01:33:30,343 --> 01:33:32,998
He kept encrypted records
of everything.Hmm.

968
01:33:33,869 --> 01:33:37,002
What about, um, him? Falk?

969
01:33:37,046 --> 01:33:39,918
Do you have anything else
on him? His real name or...

970
01:33:39,962 --> 01:33:43,182
No, he covers his tracks really well.
We have nothing on him.

971
01:33:43,226 --> 01:33:44,706
Have you shown this
to anyone else?

972
01:33:45,663 --> 01:33:46,708
No.

973
01:33:46,751 --> 01:33:48,840
I am really sorry
about your father.

974
01:33:50,102 --> 01:33:52,714
If we had enough money as bait,

975
01:33:52,757 --> 01:33:56,979
we could offer a contract
to each of the assassins,

976
01:33:57,022 --> 01:34:03,159
and then create some imaginary
bait for them to kill.

977
01:34:03,202 --> 01:34:07,424
Lure them out of the
shadows and capture them.

978
01:34:08,512 --> 01:34:10,166
How much money would you need?

979
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,824
The lead investigator,
do you know who she was?

980
01:34:16,389 --> 01:34:17,477
Agent Vos.

981
01:34:17,521 --> 01:34:20,524
Not the name she gave
you, who she was.

982
01:34:20,567 --> 01:34:22,831
You handed those files
over to Falk.

983
01:34:22,874 --> 01:34:24,746
That's the woman
that killed your father.

984
01:34:28,227 --> 01:34:29,228
No.

985
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:32,362
No!

986
01:34:38,107 --> 01:34:40,979
Once you did that, she
couldn't risk being exposed.

987
01:34:41,023 --> 01:34:42,764
So she had to get rid
of the evidence.

988
01:34:42,807 --> 01:34:46,637
That meant your uncle, the
assassins he hired, and you.

989
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,030
So she created a deadly game

990
01:34:48,073 --> 01:34:50,859
that she could manipulate
from behind the agency.

991
01:34:50,902 --> 01:34:54,427
Even used Leon, fed him
the exact lies to tell us.

992
01:34:54,471 --> 01:34:55,515
But that's not...

993
01:34:55,559 --> 01:34:57,604
My father's finger was cut off.

994
01:34:57,648 --> 01:35:00,564
Falk mirrors methods
of other assassins.

995
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:06,396
She was mimicking Ryder to
throw off the investigators.

996
01:35:08,050 --> 01:35:11,140
Everything she's done has led
to either trying to kill me,

997
01:35:11,183 --> 01:35:13,272
or for me to stand here
and kill you.

998
01:35:14,883 --> 01:35:17,015
What about the money?
Where is it?

999
01:35:17,973 --> 01:35:18,973
Gone.

1000
01:35:20,497 --> 01:35:24,675
The agency has no record of
it, or any meeting we ever had.

1001
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,198
So the money
never went to anyone.

1002
01:35:27,591 --> 01:35:28,723
Falk kept the money.

1003
01:35:30,855 --> 01:35:33,075
I got word from the agency
only an hour ago.

1004
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:36,556
They told me Agent Vos
is dead now.

1005
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,734
She was on a mission in Italy,
and apparently had a heart attack.

1006
01:37:13,392 --> 01:37:14,829
Sophie.

1007
01:37:14,872 --> 01:37:16,395
It's just me. It's okay.

1008
01:37:17,135 --> 01:37:19,834
Is it over? I hope so.

1009
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,793
I don't like that answer.

1010
01:37:24,273 --> 01:37:26,318
Oh, God, what did
they do to you?

1011
01:37:27,232 --> 01:37:29,017
It's okay.
It's okay.

1012
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:31,149
I'll heal.

1013
01:37:32,585 --> 01:37:34,022
Listen, I can't stay for long.

1014
01:37:34,065 --> 01:37:35,632
Where are you going?

1015
01:37:35,675 --> 01:37:37,436
I have to go back to the apartment.
I have to get some clothes.

1016
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:40,115
I need you to do me a favor.
You keep the door closed.

1017
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:42,552
If you're thinking about
disappearing, I don't want that.

1018
01:37:43,596 --> 01:37:44,771
We stay together.

1019
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:48,906
You promised me.

1020
01:37:57,697 --> 01:37:59,699
It's a girl? Our daughter.

1021
01:38:23,375 --> 01:38:24,376
Stupid kid.

1022
01:38:45,006 --> 01:38:48,052
Morgan, you know
your biggest mistake?

1023
01:38:48,879 --> 01:38:50,011
You want to live.

1024
01:38:52,143 --> 01:38:53,971
Not just survive,

1025
01:38:54,711 --> 01:38:55,799
but live.

1026
01:38:57,322 --> 01:38:59,585
Love. Care.

1027
01:39:01,544 --> 01:39:06,288
It makes you vulnerable.
It makes you weak.

1028
01:39:06,331 --> 01:39:08,029
If you got a shot,
you'd better take it.

1029
01:39:08,464 --> 01:39:09,856
No.

1030
01:39:10,727 --> 01:39:12,555
You're gonna suffer first.

1031
01:39:13,425 --> 01:39:14,557
Just like me.

1032
01:39:17,081 --> 01:39:19,431
Oh. How did you put it?

1033
01:39:19,475 --> 01:39:21,868
"Feel the consequences
of what you've done."

1034
01:39:21,912 --> 01:39:23,522
We have unfinished business.

1035
01:39:23,566 --> 01:39:28,049
One last contract unfulfilled.

1036
01:39:28,092 --> 01:39:29,615
You're going to kill yourself.

1037
01:39:29,659 --> 01:39:31,269
This conversation's over.

1038
01:39:31,313 --> 01:39:35,099
You and me know better than anyone
that every life has a price.

1039
01:39:35,708 --> 01:39:37,188
Hmm.

1040
01:39:37,232 --> 01:39:38,450
And I know yours.

1041
01:39:40,931 --> 01:39:42,846
Ooh.

1042
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,544
You better run fast.

1043
01:39:45,588 --> 01:39:47,372
You don't want
to miss this show.

1044
01:40:04,737 --> 01:40:07,827
Leon, Falk is still alive.
She has Sophie.

1045
01:40:07,871 --> 01:40:09,307
I need you now.

1046
01:40:09,351 --> 01:40:11,396
I'm sending you
an address. Be there.

1047
01:40:18,447 --> 01:40:19,448
Sophie?

1048
01:40:30,415 --> 01:40:31,982
Sophie!

1049
01:40:33,984 --> 01:40:35,812
I'd be still if I were you.

1050
01:40:35,855 --> 01:40:39,598
If you move your leg from that
wire, you're gonna blow up.

1051
01:40:41,165 --> 01:40:46,736
I guess we've got a little bit
less than five minutes left.

1052
01:40:53,134 --> 01:40:54,134
Give me your gun.

1053
01:40:56,485 --> 01:40:57,747
Come on, give me your gun.

1054
01:40:58,704 --> 01:40:59,705
Fuck!

1055
01:41:04,449 --> 01:41:05,449
Good boy.

1056
01:41:07,235 --> 01:41:12,066
So, we got, um,
one last game to play.

1057
01:41:12,109 --> 01:41:14,546
The game's done.
It's over. You've won.

1058
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:17,158
Let her go.
There's nothing more.

1059
01:41:17,201 --> 01:41:19,247
So here's the spin.

1060
01:41:20,683 --> 01:41:22,380
That's a countdown to disarm.

1061
01:41:22,424 --> 01:41:25,122
So in about four minutes,
you'll be safe,

1062
01:41:25,166 --> 01:41:29,344
but, um, Sophie would
have drowned.

1063
01:41:29,387 --> 01:41:31,520
So you got a decision to make.

1064
01:41:31,563 --> 01:41:35,001
Either you watch the mother
of your unborn child die

1065
01:41:35,045 --> 01:41:37,308
or you let the bomb go off,

1066
01:41:37,352 --> 01:41:40,311
and you all die together,
which is romantic.

1067
01:41:40,355 --> 01:41:44,620
Whatever choice you make,
I win, you lose.

1068
01:41:44,663 --> 01:41:47,318
The game is mine.

1069
01:41:47,362 --> 01:41:51,801
So, um, do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

1070
01:41:51,844 --> 01:41:54,020
Have you thought about a name?

1071
01:41:54,064 --> 01:41:57,111
'Cause I think, um, Falk
is pretty cute.

1072
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:03,159
Hey.

1073
01:42:04,596 --> 01:42:05,815
Come on, get up now.

1074
01:42:06,946 --> 01:42:09,514
Get up. Turn around.
Show me your face.

1075
01:42:30,535 --> 01:42:32,929
Have fun. Ciao.

1076
01:42:34,278 --> 01:42:35,323
Sophie!

1077
01:42:38,282 --> 01:42:39,414
Just stay calm.

1078
01:42:42,634 --> 01:42:43,940
Stay calm, baby.

1079
01:43:02,393 --> 01:43:04,134
Leon.

1080
01:43:04,178 --> 01:43:06,484
Help us. Please!

1081
01:43:32,641 --> 01:43:33,685
Hurry up, Leon!

1082
01:44:07,284 --> 01:44:08,285
Sophie, stay with me.

1083
01:44:10,113 --> 01:44:11,593
Stay there.
Just a couple seconds.

1084
01:44:17,599 --> 01:44:18,599
Okay.

1085
01:44:20,166 --> 01:44:21,429
Baby, stay with me.

1086
01:44:23,169 --> 01:44:25,302
Don't die on me! Breathe!

1087
01:44:28,174 --> 01:44:29,175
Wake up.

1088
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:38,489
Don't die on me, baby.
Sophie, wake up!

1089
01:44:49,587 --> 01:44:52,460
Baby. Okay.
Baby. It's okay.

1090
01:44:53,461 --> 01:44:55,506
Baby. Oh, my God.

1091
01:44:55,550 --> 01:44:57,943
Fucking bastard. No, no, no.
Sophie, it's me!

1092
01:44:57,987 --> 01:44:59,834
You told me we were safe!
Sophie, it's me! Okay.

1093
01:44:59,858 --> 01:45:02,774
You told me we were safe. It's okay.
We're safe now. Okay.

1094
01:45:02,818 --> 01:45:04,298
We're safe now. Okay.

1095
01:45:04,341 --> 01:45:06,865
Just breathe.
Just breathe. Okay.

1096
01:45:08,389 --> 01:45:09,781
I thought I lost you, baby.

1097
01:45:10,782 --> 01:45:12,393
Okay. It's okay.

1098
01:45:15,744 --> 01:45:17,049
You're okay. Okay.

1099
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,444
I have to finish this.

1100
01:45:21,489 --> 01:45:22,707
I have to finish this.

1101
01:45:25,362 --> 01:45:26,494
Get that bitch.

1102
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:33,239
Help Leon.
Call an ambulance.

1103
01:45:51,562 --> 01:45:52,562
Falk!
