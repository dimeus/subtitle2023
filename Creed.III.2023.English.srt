- You did?
Where'd you send 'em?

353
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,740
She still up in bel air?

354
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,340
Yeah, she's still there.
Same house.

355
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,280
But I never got 'em.

356
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,840
You know I watched
every one of your fights

357
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,510
You finally
made it to Africa, huh?

358
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,850
- You seen that?
- Saw that.

359
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,240
Made me proud
how you ended your run.

360
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,800
Look like you still remember
some of them moves

361
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,740
You know what I remember?

362
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,080
You knocking my ass out.

363
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,490
[Dame laughing]

364
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,790
You know what I remember?

365
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,880
Helping your big ass back up.

366
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,930
Remember that?

367
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,720
- Yeah, you did.
- All right, then.

368
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,850
You got work?

369
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,550
I got plans. [Chuckles]

370
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,460
Keep my nose clean.
Keep my po off my ass.

371
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,660
[Adonis] Mm.

372
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,160
Listen, if there's anything
I can do for you,

373
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,700
if I can help at all, just ask.

374
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,310
What am I talking about?
You just came home.

375
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,540
Whatever you need. Aight?
Don't hesitate, bruh.

376
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,580
I'm straight, bro.

377
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,750
I'm good.
I got it all situated.

378
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,840
I ain't come to see you
for no handout.

379
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,680
Nah, I didn't mean it
like that. It was...

380
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,380
Respect.

381
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,720
So, what's the plan?

382
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,240
Same program
last time you saw me.

383
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,960
I wanna be champ.

384
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,950
You still wanna box?

385
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,880
Hey, I know I've been
away a long time.

386
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,660
I kept myself in shape.

387
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,330
I got some moves
you ain't seen yet.

388
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
Yeah. You...

389
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,930
- You looking diesel.
- I ain't joking.

390
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,150
I'm ready.

391
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,460
I still got gas in the tank.

392
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,590
And I gotta get me that chain.

393
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,990
Can't be "diamond" dame
looking bummy.

394
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,960
- "Diamond" dame.
- [Dame laughing]

395
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
That's right.

396
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
All right.

397
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,870
Come by the gym.

398
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,830
Get you set up with Duke.

399
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,660
- For real?
- Yeah.

400
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
For real.

401
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,410
All right, then.

402
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,370
Thank you.

- [Bianca laughs]
- What's so funny?

409
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,346
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying
to convince your mama

410
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,610
so I can have
my own live-in braider.

[Bianca and Adonis laugh]

412
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,090
Yeah.
Careful what you wish for.

413
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,050
- Oh, I'm not worried.
- [Mary-Anne chuckles]

414
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,450
It's actually not a bad idea.

415
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,620
And how you feeling, mama?
You good?

416
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,100
I'm good.

417
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,190
- [Adonis] You sure?
- [Mary-Anne] Oh, yeah.

418
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,760
Okay.

419
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,560
I'd be better if my son
showed up on time for dinner.

420
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,070
Ouch. Uh, sorry.

421

- Mmm.
- I just got caught up.

There. Look at that.

in this family?

You are.

No. You.

427
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,710
Go see for yourself.

Thank you grandma. I love you.

your hands full with that one.

- No. She's the best.
- Yes, we do.

She is.

[Bianca] Baby, not tonight.

444
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,730

about this.

- [Bianca] One thing at a time.
- [Adonis] Okay.

Okay. We are not doing this
this evening, okay?

I am not gonna have

Okay?

- Mom. That's...

It's a little funny.

460
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,040
And you're not helping.

461

You know
that we're worried about you.

00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,866
- That's it.
We can leave it now.

after the last one.

[Grunting]

473
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,090
Think you might've
checked with me?

474
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,950
And homey older than you.

475
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,710
I'm just trying
to give him a break.

476
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,390
No! This ain't the ymca.

477
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,950
Look around, Duke.

478
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,350
You see anybody lining up
to get in the ring with Felix?

479
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,440
All I'm saying is, let him spar.

480
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,830
Felix got a fight coming up,
and we have zero bodies.

481
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,186
I mean, absolutely nobody
wants to get in the ring

482
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,410
I know what you doin', Donnie.

483
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,500
You don't owe this dude shit.

484
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,290
Nothing.

485
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
But let's spar.

486
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Let's do it.

487
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,630
Felix, Felix, yo. Listen up.

488
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,510
Adonis brought somebody in
for you to spar.

489
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,650
[Adonis] Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

490
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,440
- Huh?
- We on.

491
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,490

right?

496
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,620
[Duke] All right.

497

Felix, meet Damian.
He gonna spar with you.

498
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,640
You still remember
how to do that, yeah?

499
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,900
You got this.

500
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,960
[Duke] Felix, stay focused.
Work on timing.

501
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,140

502
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,530
[Thud]

503
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,240
Why's this kid picking on her?

504
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,020
Well, I'm just asking.

505
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,110
Sign.

506
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,370
I'm sorry.

507
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,580
I think...

508
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,240
She probably wants
to get some attention -

509
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,120
hold on. Why is my daughter
in trouble and not her?

510
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,520
She can't protect herself?

511
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,330
Obviously we're concerned
about Amara.

512
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,600
Feeling comfortable here
is important.

513
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,510
Of course.

514
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,570
But we understand fighting
isn't the way to handle things.

515
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,300
[Adonis] Mm-hmm.

516
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,700
Look, we love Amara.

517
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,700
She's an academically
exceptional child...

518
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
She's thriving.

519
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,410
She just... fights.

520
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,540
So, you wanna
teach her how to fight?

521
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,780
I didn't think I had to,
at a deaf school like that,

522
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,190
- but maybe I was wrong.
- Wait. [Sighs]

523
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,070
What does that mean,
"at a deaf school like that,"

524
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,720
I mean,
what did you expect, Adonis?

525
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,636
[Adonis] Then she should learn
how to defend herself.

526
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,116
Okay, first of all,
I'm not saying that

527
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,686
she shouldn't know
how to defend herself.

528
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,150
I'm just saying
what that means to me

529
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,950
is different
than what it means to you.

530
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,600
What if she's someplace
she's supposed to be safe,

531
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,280
She won't know
how to protect herself.

532
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,490
Where's that coming from?

533
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,450
Nowhere. It's just a fact.

534
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,480
Okay.

535
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,530
Another fact is that,
I think, as parents,

536
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,010
it's actually our responsibility

537
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,100
to teach her
how to assess her emotions.

538
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,140
So you want Amara, right,
to hold hands with this bully

539
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,970
and start talking
about her feelings?

540
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,170
That's not real life.

541
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,800
Okay, what do you
want her to do?

542
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,936
You want her
to never talk about

543
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,550
Not even to us,
and all she can do

544
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,726
Look,
I know that you think that

545
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,550
but now that you don't have
an outlet anymore,

546
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,900
you should think about
maybe talking

547
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,080
If not to me, to somebody.

548
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,920
Or, I don't know, d.
Get a hobby.

549
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,690
- Okay, I'll get a hobby.
- Oh, yeah?

550
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,740
Yeah, you.

551
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,866
I'ma go down to the studio.
I'ma start

552
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,740
That's not funny, d.

553
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,920
Look,
I know that you think that

554
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,840
but she has got to know why
she wants to fight,

555
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,496
And the only solution
to every problem

556
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,450
Yeah, you're right.
And sometimes it is.

557
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,650
[Doorbell ringing]

558
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,390
[Adonis] All right,
let's just have a good time.

559
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,760
Okay,
I see you made it all right.

560
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,420
Oh, yeah. I just asked him,
"where the black family

561
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,940
[All chuckling]

562
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,680
- I'm kidding.
- Yeah.

563
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,900
- What's up, man?
- 'Sup?

564
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,030
There's other ones around.

565
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,640
I ain't see none. Here you go.

566
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,080
Thank you.

567
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,960
- Nice to meet you, Ms. Bianca.
- Pleasure.

568
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,430
- You never bought me
no flowers.

569
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,220
- Nah. I'm okay.
No, no, it's all right.

570
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,830
- Hey, y'all got
a beautiful home.

571
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,090
Hey... dinner time.

572
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,770
[Dame] You got
the see-through floors?

573
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,280
Oh.

574
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,550
Whoa. All right.

575
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,720
Amara.

576
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,510
- Amara?
- [Adonis] Mm-hmm.

577
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,560
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

578
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,080
Nice to meet you.

579
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,160
[Bianca] She says, "you too."
[Chuckles]

580
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
Ah, hell yeah.

581
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,570
Need water?

582
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,440
Thank you again.

583
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,000
Thank you very much.

584
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,830
[Dame] Dawg,
I still can't get over this.

585
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,310
This square
got him a whole mansion.

586
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,270
Married a... a genuine rock star.

587
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,760
- Yeah, I did.
- Mmm.

588
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,920
How many gold records you got?

589
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,016
- I have a few. [Chuckles]
- [Adonis] She bein' modest.

590
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,840
She bein' real modest.

591
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,540
No, but it's mostly
artists I produce,

592
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,020
- And she produces?
- She does.

593
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,370
Donnie. You punching up.

594
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,160
So, Ms. Producer,
when's your next show?

595
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,720
I don't really
perform like that these days.

596
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,940
Yeah, I took a break,
'cause I was...

597
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,950
I was having some issues
with my hearing on stage.

598
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,510
Now I'm trying to be careful
and preserve

599
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,790
so, I'm producing.

600
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,650
Yeah.

601
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,360
Not any time soon. [Chuckles]

602
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,570
Still hard
to give that part up, though.

603
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:37,180
Yeah. It's not
the only thing I love,

604
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,876
- [Adonis]
It's an adjustment...

605
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,056
[Adonis] ...For the both of us.

606
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,970
So, how long
have you known each other?

607
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,320
- [Sighs] I mean...
- We go back. Way back.

608
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,500
We was like...
We was like brothers.

609
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,510
Shared a room for two years
at the Jeff.

610
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,940
Yeah, something like that.

611
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,246
You know how it went.
He went off

612
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,510
The Jeff, right.

613
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,780
Yeah, the group home.

614
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,000
You remember them bedbugs?

615
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,340
I try to forget 'em.

616
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,660
[Chuckling] Yeah.

617
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,320
I can't forget them bugs.

618
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,390
- I'm gonna get her to bed.
- [Adonis] Okay.

619
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,140
- You two stay, catch up.
- [Adonis] Okay.

620
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,140
Oh, invite him
to the label party.

621
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,660
- Definitely will do that.
- Yeah.

622
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,790
I heard that. I'm invited
to the label party.

623
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,190
[Laughing]

624
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,496
- You're invited.
- [Dame] Thank you.

625
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,760
Yeah.
Thank you so much for coming.

626
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,030
- Yeah, no doubt.
My pleasure to meet you.

627
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,210
[Dame] I can't believe
you moved back out here

628
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,560
You used to love
coming out to the hood.

629
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,640
What?

630
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,780
- Domesticated and shit.
- Ah, come on, man.

631
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,046
- [Dame chuckles]
- See what happens

632
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,690
- Yeah, all right, bro.
- Aight?

633
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,490
- The women run this household.
I just live here.

634
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,370
That's what happens, man.
You get married, a family.

635
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,110
It's crazy.

636
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,240
Pour up.

637
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,730
Can't believe you traded it in
for a monkey suit.

638
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,740
Oh, you know,
a suit has some advantages.

639
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,690
You saying that
like I got soft

640
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,866
- Like I lost this
sneak-attack.

641
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,970
Okay, I see.
The champ's still got

642
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,890
All I'm saying is,
I left boxing,

643
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,190
See,
that's what I'm saying, bro.

644
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,660
I mean, look,
I know you got a ship to run,

645
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,146
but I ain't keep
my stuff together

646
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,890
just to be some punching bag
for some chump.

647
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,580
You feel me?

648
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,820
Don't sleep on Felix. Aight?

649
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,040
He got it the hard way.
He earned it.

650
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,170
I did 18 years
the hard way, bro.

651
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,220
Maybe I ain't make myself clear.

652
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
I want a title shot.

653
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,650
Dame...

654
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,216
[Chuckles] I don't know
what you think,

655
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,090
Felix so cold,
what he got to lose?

656
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,486
You think I can snap
my fingers and make you

657
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,790
Ain't that what happened to you?

658
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
[Scoffs]

659
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,420
It's like this, bro.

660
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
I respect you...

661
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,280
But my clock tickin'.

662
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,900
It's now or never for me.

663
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,690
And I wanna help you,
like I said I would.

664
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,350
But, man,
what you asking me, it's...

665
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
It's kinda impossible.

666
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,710
You don't know
what it's like, bro.

667
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,750
All that time in them...

668
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,710
In them walls.

669
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,850
Impossible?

670
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,810
They take your name.

671
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,990
And they give you a number.

672
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
That's how it start.

673
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,470
I was the best, though.

674
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,220
Yeah, you were.

675
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,260
I was, bro.

676
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,740
But I never got a chance
to prove that.

677
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,130
Look, all I'm saying, bro, if...

678
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,490
If Apollo creed
could take a chance

679
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,280
Why can't you?

680
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,460
Did you sleep okay?

681
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,240
[Adonis] Mm-hmm.

682
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,920
[Bianca] You were
grinding your teeth.

683
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,910
How was the rest of last night?

684
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,460
[Adonis] Mm...

685
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,290
- It was, uh... it was good.
- Yeah?

686
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,700
Just catching up.

687
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,040
Hey,
why didn't you ever tell me

688
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,660
There wasn't a lot to say.

689
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,490
[Bianca] Hmm.

690
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,670
How old were you?

691
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,720
Uh, I was around Amara's age.

692
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,200
You don't wanna talk about it?

693
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,940
It's okay.

694
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,900
- No. [Stammers]
- It's okay.

695
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,950
Nah, it's dame.

696
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,260
You know he asked me
to fight Felix?

697
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,860
- For real?
- Yeah. [Chuckles]

698
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,790
Heavyweight champion
of the world,

699
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,350
So what'd you say?

700
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,000
I said no.

701
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,170
It's impossible, you know?

702
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,370
People wait their whole lives
for a shot like that.

703
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,930

1227
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:51,230
It's aight. Cool out, bro.

1228
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,840
Give me that.

1229
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,200
That's what we on?

1230
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,360
What's up, Donnie?
You all right?

1231
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,290
Man. Nah, nah,
you tell me, bro.

1232
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,600
You've been playing me
this whole time.

1233
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,890
Guess you did
get them letters, huh?

1234
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:14,090
Why'd you lie to me?

1235
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,720
I vouched for you.

1236
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,950
I brought you
into my home, bro.

1237
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,160
I put money up for you.

1238
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,206
- Put the gloves on your hands
like you asked.

1239
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,620
You feel me? [Laughing]

1240
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,050
You put the gloves on my hands?

1241
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,230
Oh, homey. [Chuckles]

1242
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:36,350
You must be punchy.

[Dame, crowd laughing]

1244
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:42,360
'Cause if memory serves,
you used to carry my gloves.

1245
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,880
Get your shit
and get out the gym.

1246
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,620
Oh, Donnie, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

1247
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,820
You think I need you?

1248
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,190
No. When I got locked up,
I needed you.

1249
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:56,900
[Chuckling] When I came home,
yeah, bro, I needed you.

1250
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:00,040
But look around, bro.

1251
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,160
- I'm the champ! [Laughing]
- [Crowd] Yeah!

1252
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,160
And I don't need you
for nothing or... or nothing.

[Laughing]

1254
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:11,880
Who alone now?

1255
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,870
Yeah, that's right. Run away.

1256
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,950
Run away.
That's the one thing

1257
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:23,530

1260
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,020
What was that?

1261
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:32,990
- What'd you call me?
- Oh, you mad?

1262
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,250
You mad?

1263
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,766
Try spending
half your life in a cell

1264
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:41,690
watching somebody else
live your life.

1265
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:45,390
You turned your back on me,
homey.

1266
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,960
Hey, but look, don't trip.

1267

[Chuckles]

1268
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,030
Hey, come here.

Remember this?

This title?

1271

All this? [Chuckles]

1272
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,710
Hey, I'm just getting started,
little brother.

1273
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,750
I'm coming for it all.

1274
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,710
And what's that
supposed to mean?

1275
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:09,720
Are you threatening me?

1276
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:16,100
[Adonis grunts]

1277
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,640
Ain't no threats here, bro.

1278
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,190
Just promises here, homey.

Come here. Let's see.

1282
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,610
Yeah.

1283
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:33,780
Help yourself up for once.

1284
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,220
See how it feel.

[Bianca]
Where were you all night?

1289
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:12,080
You didn't get
any of my calls then,

1290
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,730
What happened to your eye?

1291
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:19,930
Nothing.

1292
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,230
Are you okay?

1293
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,991
[Scoffs] Not today.
I ain't got time

1294
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:33,090
Okay. Well, then
what do you have time for?

1295
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:35,530
Let me know.

1296
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:38,226
Because I have been trying
to talk to you for

1297
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,250
All right?

1298
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,240
Please, can you tell me
what is going on.

1299
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:45,710
Is it me?

1300
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,540
No.
It's nothing to do with you.

[Bianca sighs]

1302
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:57,870
Is it about Leon?

1303
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,520
What? Who told you that?

1304
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:05,880
Dame.

1305
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:09,710
Is there something else
you wanna tell me?

[Bianca sighs]

1307
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:16,570
D, you have got to
open up at some point.

1308
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:19,090
I don't know what else
to tell you.

1309
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:21,290
What do you want me to say?
What do you wanna hear?

1310
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,790
Some sad story?

1311
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:24,880
You're trying
to feel sorry for me

1312
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,106
I don't wanna
feel sorry for you!

1313

I wanna know
what is going on with you

1314

There's nothing to talk about!
I don't wanna

It's dead! Leave it! Leave it!
Let it lie!

You figure out your shit, d.

1321
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:56,100
Because what cannot happen
is her seeing you like this.

1322

Do you understand?

1323
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,800
[Softly] Yeah.

I didn't mean it. [Sniffles]

Mm-mmm.

Just like your father.

That's why he fought so hard.
You know that, right?

Yeah.

to do that.

All this shit came back too.

1385

I didn't know how to handle it.

1386
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,980
But you were always
really good at that.

It comes easy to you.

1388
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:07,430
Doesn't come easy to me.

Doesn't.

I still got a lot of stuff
that I'm trying to figure out,

1391
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,990
and I don't always know
how to talk about it either.

You know, Mary-Anne
was the closest thing

1393
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,690
I've had to a mom
in a really long time.

1394
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:23,310
I could talk to her.

1395
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:25,100
Now she's gone.

1396
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,790
And when I stopped performing,
it was really hard to accept

1397
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:35,760
that my dreams didn't turn out
the way that I imagined

1398
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,850
And that still hurts me.

1399
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:43,120
A lot.

1400
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,240
But I just made a choice
to try to move on

1401
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,340
and be happy
about what I do have.

1402
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:58,170
But it's not easy. [Chuckles]

1403
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:02,870
I just try.

1404
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,670
Leon...

1405
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,760
Was the dad at the group home

1406
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,420
where I lived with dame.

1407
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:32,510
I'm not saying me
and dame were angels.

1408
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,460
Okay? But...

1409
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,390
No kid deserves
to get beat on like we did.

1410
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:41,690
You feel me?

1411
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:46,700
That night
at the liquor store,

1412
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:51,920
And I snapped.

1413
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:57,450
And I hit him.

1414
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,670
I kept hitting him.

1415
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:07,030
And his boys jumped on me.

1416
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,460
So dame pulled a gun.

1417
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,210
Cops pulled up.

1418
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,770
We tried to run.

1419
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:19,600
Dame got caught. I got away.

1420
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,170
I ran.

1421
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:26,780
You were a kid.

1422
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,990
You were scared.
Anybody would've run.

1423
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:35,130
And dame had a gun, Adonis.
That's not on you.

1424
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:37,270
Yeah, but when he went down,
I didn't reach out.

1425
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:40,800
I never called.

1426
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:42,710
I didn't write.

1427
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,230
[Stammers]

1428
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:51,420
After a while, it felt easier
to pretend like I forgot.

1429
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,510
You know, just...

1430
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,450
Act like it never happened.

1431
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:00,380
But that doesn't
make you responsible

1432
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:06,210
You are a good man, Adonis.

1433
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,340
I don't know anymore.

1434
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,550
You have got to try
to forgive yourself,

1435
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:16,090
so that you can begin
to believe that you deserve

1436
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,360
Because you do.

1437
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:23,320
Don't let him destroy
everything you've built.

1438
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:26,740
But, b, he's not gonna stop.

1439
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,320
Then you make him.

1440
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,370
There's only one way
that dame's gonna listen.

1441
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,770
If that's what you gotta do,
then...

1442
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,590
All right.

1443
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:45,310
At 26 and one, he's the former
heavyweight champion

1444
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:47,980
One of the greatest fighters
in the history of boxing.

1445
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:50,461
The one and only Adonis creed
is sitting right next to me.

1446
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,166
Welcome to the show, my man.
How you doing?

1447
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:53,830
I'm doing okay, man.
Thanks for having me.

1448
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,770
Yeah... [stammers]
Thank you for being here.

1449
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:58,730
You called to be on this show,
which you've never done.

1450
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:01,650
I wanna know why you felt
the need

1451
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:03,650
to come on national television
today to speak.

1452
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:04,810
What's on your mind?

1453
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,610
When I walked away from boxing,

1454
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:08,850
- I walked away
with some unfinished business.

1455
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:11,570
Gotta be talking about dame.
Gotta be talking about him.

1456
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,130
Let's just get this
out of the way.

1457
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:14,536
You know I believe
you're the best

1458

in the world,

1459
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,880
three years ago.

1460
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,756
It's been a minute
since you've been

1461
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,456
so maybe you haven't heard
what they've been saying

1462
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,970
<i>A: Conlan.</i>

1463
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:24,810
<i>He was beyond his prime
when you beat him.</i>

01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,240
<i>B: Dame.</i>

1465

<i>He's the next king of boxing.
Not you. Okay?</i>

<i>about you dirty,</i>

1468

Hey, turn that up.

1469
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,990
To anybody who'll listen,
he questions your manhood,

1470
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:38,420
he talks about your family.

1471
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:40,180
He talks about
how you can't be trusted,

1472
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,600
and that you run out
on your boys.

1473
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,170
No, no. No.
Wait. Let me just...

1474
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:45,040
Hold on.
We got a call coming in.

1475
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,260
We got a call.
Put him on, right now.

<i>You want a tissue?</i>

1478
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:52,490
<i>Want me to come on there
and give you a hug?</i>

1479
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,576
<i>Aight, look, I'm just telling
everybody who you really are.</i>

1480
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,700
<i>- How you run out on family.</i>
- [Clears throat]

1481
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:01,230
Dame, uh, not like this.

1482
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,666
<i>This ain't the way to handle it.</i>

1483
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:04,760
Oh, bad news, bro.
This is live.

1484
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,800
So, I mean, this how
we gonna handle it now.

Guess you did learn
a few moves without me.

Dame, I'm sorry.

All those years...

Hey, d.
