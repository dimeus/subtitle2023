00:02:34.368 --> 00:02:35.786
What is this place?

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:55.389
<i>My life doesn't really make sense.</i>

00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:56.682
Hey.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.560
<i>I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.</i>

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.897
<i>"Scott, you're a divorced ex-con.
How are you an Avenger?</i>

00:03:04.064 --> 00:03:05.858
<i>"Why are you time traveling
with Captain America?</i>

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:07.526
<i>"That doesn't make sense."</i>

00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:10.946
<i>A lot has changed about my life.</i>

00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:13.657
<i>But everywhere I go,
people ask me the same thing.</i>

00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:14.992
Can you take a picture with my dog?

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.536
<i>"Scott, what about now?</i>

00:03:17.703 --> 00:03:18.745
<i>"What's next?</i>

00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:20.330
<i>"Where does the ride take you?"</i>

00:03:21.164 --> 00:03:23.208
<i>If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.</i>

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:24.376
All right.

00:03:25.836 --> 00:03:28.964
<i>-It's been a crazy few years. For everyone.
</i>-Hey, hi. How are you?

00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:30.549
Everything is ready for you.

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:31.717
You're too much.

00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:33.260
No, no, no.

00:03:33.427 --> 00:03:34.511
Your money's no good here.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.097
-Are we still talking about that?
-Yes, of course.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.558
Rubin, you are the best.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.269
Thank you, Spider-Man.

00:03:44.188 --> 00:03:46.982
<i>So, let's make time for the stuff
that really matters.</i>

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:48.358
<i>Like friends.</i>

00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:51.153
<i>Friends you didn't even know you had.</i>

00:03:53.238 --> 00:03:55.240
<i>Remember the people who got you here.</i>

00:03:55.407 --> 00:03:56.658
<i>You couldn't have done it without them.</i>

00:03:57.576 --> 00:04:00.662
<i>Hey, I'm just a guy who got fired
from Baskin-Robbins.</i>

00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:03.248
<i>Sometimes you just get lucky.</i>

00:04:03.415 --> 00:04:05.375
<i>I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.</i>

00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:06.919
<i>I think you know who she is.</i>

00:04:08.086 --> 00:04:10.172
<i>She's taken back her dad's company.</i>

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.091
<i>Now she's using the Pym Particle
for global change.</i>

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.512
<i>A lot of people say they want
to save the world...</i>

00:04:16.678 --> 00:04:18.471
<i>but Hope, she saves it every day.</i>

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.640
Thank you.

00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:22.434
Thank you so much.

00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:26.522
<i>Reforestation. Affordable housing.
Food production.</i>

00:04:26.688 --> 00:04:28.273
<i>She's not wasting a second.</i>

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:36.532
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

00:04:37.074 --> 00:04:39.034
<i>None of this should have happened.</i>

00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:40.202
<i>But it did.</i>

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.830
<i>It's a pretty good world.</i>

00:04:43.997 --> 00:04:45.707
<i>I'm glad we saved it.</i>

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:48.544
"Do I miss the action?

00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:50.837
"Sometimes.

00:04:51.338 --> 00:04:53.382
"Will I be there when the Avengers need me?

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:54.508
"Absolutely.

00:04:54.675 --> 00:04:56.426
"I'd never turn my back on them.

00:04:57.135 --> 00:05:00.430
"But right now, the only job I want
is being a dad.

00:05:01.765 --> 00:05:03.016
"I love you, Cassie.

00:05:04.268 --> 00:05:05.686
"Thanks for being my hero.

00:05:07.354 --> 00:05:09.314
"And I'm sorry I missed some birthdays.

00:05:11.024 --> 00:05:13.277
"And for the rest of you kids out there...

00:05:13.443 --> 00:05:14.570
"word of advice.

00:05:15.654 --> 00:05:17.072
"Look out for the little guy.

"Make mistakes.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.701
"Take chances.

00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:23.787
"Because if there's one thing
life's taught me...

"there's always room to grow."

00:05:33.672 --> 00:05:35.299
Sorry, that's me.

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.427
Why is jail calling?

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.929
Lang!

00:05:42.097 --> 00:05:43.849
-Lang!
-I'm here.

00:05:44.016 --> 00:05:45.434
All right, come on. Let's go.

00:05:47.436 --> 00:05:48.520
Come on.

00:05:52.524 --> 00:05:54.985
Hey. Is she okay? Have you heard anything?

00:05:55.152 --> 00:05:56.153
Not yet. No.

00:05:57.237 --> 00:05:58.572
Hi, Hope.
Hey, Dad.

00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:00.532
Cassie. What happened?

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:01.700
Sign here.

00:06:01.867 --> 00:06:04.703
You know, just jail stuff.

00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:06.496
Give it back.

00:06:07.956 --> 00:06:08.916
I know it was you.

00:06:09.082 --> 00:06:10.083
Are you sure?

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.460
I mean, it was kind of hard to see...

00:06:11.627 --> 00:06:14.504
through all that tear gas you fired
into the park full of peaceful protestors.

00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:15.422
Where is it?

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:17.633
I'm sorry.
This must be really embarrassing for you.

00:06:21.803 --> 00:06:22.804
I did find this though.

00:06:28.143 --> 00:06:29.686
You shrank a cop car?

00:06:29.853 --> 00:06:30.938
What were you thinking?

00:06:31.104 --> 00:06:32.856
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

00:06:33.023 --> 00:06:34.942
They were clearing out a homeless camp
in the middle of the night.

00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:36.860
-No, I'm not saying that...
-And where do they expect them to go?

00:06:37.027 --> 00:06:38.946
It's not their fault that they lost
their homes in the Blip.

00:06:39.112 --> 00:06:39.947
I know that.

00:06:40.113 --> 00:06:43.033
No one can even afford rent right now,
unless you're some trust-fund asshole.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.284
I'm not telling you what to do.

00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:45.744
-I'm just saying...
-Telling her what to do.

00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:47.246
Telling me exactly what to do.

00:06:47.412 --> 00:06:48.872
No, you do what you want.

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.666
I'm suggesting another way to do it.

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:52.000
Okay.

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:53.460
You know, I promised your mom...

00:06:53.627 --> 00:06:56.088
that you would only use this stuff
when one of us was around.

00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:57.256
It's really dangerous tech.

00:06:57.422 --> 00:06:58.757
I know it's dangerous.

00:06:58.924 --> 00:07:01.176
What if the cops took it from you?
What if you lost it?

00:07:01.343 --> 00:07:02.344
I didn't lose the suit.

00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:03.345
You have a suit?

00:07:03.512 --> 00:07:04.721
Wait, you have a suit?

00:07:04.888 --> 00:07:06.265
I know how to
take care of myself, okay?

00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:08.308
Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.

00:07:09.518 --> 00:07:10.519
Ouch.

00:07:13.105 --> 00:07:14.565
-I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
-I know.

00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:16.024
That's okay. It's all right.

00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:17.276
I get it.

00:07:17.442 --> 00:07:19.987
I just think you should get
to have a normal life.

00:07:20.153 --> 00:07:21.947
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee...

00:07:22.114 --> 00:07:23.991
tried to kill me in my room when I was six.

00:07:24.908 --> 00:07:26.618
I've never had a normal life.

00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:29.413
How about some music?

00:07:29.955 --> 00:07:32.082
<i>"And in that moment, all I could think was...</i>

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:34.543
<i>"'How did the Hulk turn me into a baby?</i>

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.545
<i>"'Will I be a baby forever?</i>

00:07:36.712 --> 00:07:37.963
<i>"'Am I the Hulk's baby?'"</i>

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.840
Dad, are you listening to your own book?

00:07:40.007 --> 00:07:42.384
<i>-"But I was ready for anything.
</i>-Hmm? No, that's...

00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:44.094
-It's just the radio.
<i>-"Steve and I grew close over that."</i>

00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:45.762
-Dad, turn it off.
-It's so weird.

00:07:45.929 --> 00:07:47.764
Something's wrong with this switch.
It won't turn off.

00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:48.974
I said turn it off.

00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:50.350
What's that? Turn it up? All right.

00:07:50.517 --> 00:07:53.103
<i>"A little after that,
a raccoon from space showed up.</i>

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.897
<i>"I don't think he knew my name.</i>

00:07:55.063 --> 00:07:57.399
<i>"I was just happy to meet a raccoon
who could talk."</i>

00:08:00.694 --> 00:08:02.112
Excuse me.

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:03.363
Thank you.

00:08:05.157 --> 00:08:06.241
All right.

00:08:07.993 --> 00:08:09.411
Your Nobel Prize is in the mail.

00:08:09.578 --> 00:08:12.122
It better be. I just saved eight bucks.

00:08:12.873 --> 00:08:14.249
God, I admire you.

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:15.626
Thank you.

00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:18.420
I missed this.

00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:20.339
No pizza in the Quantum Realm?

00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:23.425
No. No anything.

00:08:23.592 --> 00:08:25.844
You know, Mom, you can talk about it.

00:08:26.386 --> 00:08:27.387
If you want.

00:08:27.554 --> 00:08:30.557
Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.

00:08:32.518 --> 00:08:34.144
I wanna live right now.

00:08:38.232 --> 00:08:41.400
So, Cassie, did you make any new friends
in the slammer this time?

00:08:41.568 --> 00:08:42.653
Grandpa.

00:08:43.111 --> 00:08:44.112
"This time"?

00:08:44.905 --> 00:08:45.739
Was there a last time?

00:08:45.906 --> 00:08:47.824
I mean, last time barely counts.

00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:49.952
I didn't know that.

00:08:50.118 --> 00:08:50.994
Why didn't you call me?

00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:52.412
'Cause I knew you'd be like this.

00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:54.414
I would've just broken you out with ants.

00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:55.916
All right, you know what? Family meeting.

00:08:56.083 --> 00:08:57.084
Can we have a family meeting?

00:08:57.251 --> 00:08:58.252
Isn't that what we're doing?

00:08:58.418 --> 00:08:59.378
Yeah, I mean about this.

00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:01.421
About everybody being so fine with this.

00:09:03.173 --> 00:09:05.425
Look, you wanna help. I get it.

00:09:05.592 --> 00:09:07.094
I do, Cassie. I really do.

00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:08.512
But I don't want you wasting your life.

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.806
At least I'm still trying to
do something with mine.

00:09:13.183 --> 00:09:15.018
I literally saved the world.

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:16.019
Oh, did you?

00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:17.896
Well, yeah, you never mentioned
that before.

00:09:18.063 --> 00:09:19.690
Hey, everybody, Scott saved the world.

00:09:19.857 --> 00:09:21.024
How was that for you, Scott?

00:09:21.191 --> 00:09:22.484
You should write a book about it.

00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:24.069
Ha ha. Hilarious.

00:09:24.236 --> 00:09:26.113
Yeah, you're welcome for all not being dust.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.739
And what do you do now?

00:09:29.575 --> 00:09:30.909
Sign books?

00:09:32.202 --> 00:09:33.912
Aren't you the guy who broke into VistaCorp?

00:09:34.413 --> 00:09:35.789
Aren't you the guy who flew all the way
to Germany...

00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:37.916
just to fight Captain America at the airport?

00:09:38.083 --> 00:09:40.252
Fight with Captain America at the airport.

00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:43.005
Wouldn't fight Captain America.

00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:44.173
Not insane.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.466
People still need help, Dad.

00:09:47.634 --> 00:09:50.262
At least we're trying to do something
that matters.

00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:54.808
Who's "we"?

00:09:56.643 --> 00:09:58.103
What are you three up to?

00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:00.022
Science.

00:10:02.065 --> 00:10:03.400
With ants.

00:10:04.318 --> 00:10:05.569
Ant science.

00:10:06.945 --> 00:10:08.113
I don't believe you.

00:10:10.032 --> 00:10:11.325
Let's just show him.

00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:16.830
What are they building?

00:10:16.997 --> 00:10:18.123
Are you doing this?

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.501
Actually, no, they built their own tech.

00:10:21.668 --> 00:10:23.128
Pretty smart ants.

00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:25.047
Okay, so when you were all...

00:10:25.214 --> 00:10:28.217
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

00:10:28.383 --> 00:10:30.677
And I started reading Grandpa Hank's
old journals...

00:10:30.844 --> 00:10:32.804
and I got really into the Quantum Realm
and...

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.681
The Quantum Realm?

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.185
I know we all have a history there,
and I didn't want to freak anyone out...

00:10:38.352 --> 00:10:39.269
but we've been talking about it.

00:10:39.436 --> 00:10:40.854
She had some questions, okay?

00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:44.191
I can't help if people are inspired by me.

00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:49.363
So, you've been studying the Quantum Realm?

00:10:51.156 --> 00:10:52.282
Why didn't you ask me about it?

00:10:52.449 --> 00:10:54.535
I tried, Mom.

00:10:54.701 --> 00:10:55.827
A lot.

00:10:55.994 --> 00:10:57.663
You never wanted to talk about it.

00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:59.081
Cassie's just been curious...

00:10:59.248 --> 00:11:00.916
and we gave her some pointers.

00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:04.711
This isn't exactly ant science, is it, Henry?

00:11:05.587 --> 00:11:07.881
You know how dangerous the Quantum Realm is.

00:11:08.048 --> 00:11:08.882
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:10.592
Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.

00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:12.594
That's why we made this.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.139
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

00:11:18.934 --> 00:11:20.227
But Quantum.

00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:23.856
We just need a map.

00:11:24.439 --> 00:11:27.442
And then we can study and explore
the entire Quantum Realm.

00:11:28.569 --> 00:11:30.362
Never even have to go.

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:35.409
Your daughter built a subatomic
Hubble Telescope in a basement.

00:11:38.453 --> 00:11:40.873
You know, if I had something like this
when you were gone...

00:11:43.876 --> 00:11:45.210
then I could have found you.

00:11:48.714 --> 00:11:49.715
It's amazing.

00:11:50.757 --> 00:11:51.967
I'm blown away.

00:11:54.386 --> 00:11:55.679
How does it work?

00:11:55.846 --> 00:11:58.807
It's kinda like that two-way radio
we used to have.

00:11:59.224 --> 00:12:00.893
You send a signal down from here...

00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:03.020
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

00:12:03.187 --> 00:12:04.146
Wait. Wait a minute.

00:12:04.563 --> 00:12:08.108
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

00:12:09.818 --> 00:12:10.819
Yeah.

00:12:10.986 --> 00:12:13.197
-Shut it down now.
-Janet...

00:12:13.363 --> 00:12:15.073
-Why would we shut it...
-What's wrong?

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.325
You have to turn it off!

00:12:16.491 --> 00:12:18.035
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.789
Janet?

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:28.503
There's something I should have told...

00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:03.705
Dad?

00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:07.584
No!

00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:09.253
-No!
-Mom!

00:13:09.795 --> 00:13:11.171
No!

00:13:12.548 --> 00:13:13.549
Damn it!

00:13:15.676 --> 00:13:16.635
Dad?

00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:49.960
Dad!

00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:56.717
Dad!

00:14:21.909 --> 00:14:22.910
Cassie.

00:14:28.457 --> 00:14:29.458
Dad!

00:14:29.917 --> 00:14:31.335
Oh, Dad. Come on.

00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:33.545
Okay.

00:14:33.712 --> 00:14:34.546
Are you okay?

00:14:34.713 --> 00:14:35.839
Yeah. I'm okay.

00:14:50.938 --> 00:14:53.315
Where are we?

00:15:11.416 --> 00:15:12.417
Mom!

00:15:13.835 --> 00:15:15.045
Dad!

00:15:15.212 --> 00:15:16.922
Hope. Over here.

00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:20.592
Are you okay?

00:15:21.593 --> 00:15:23.011
We should be dead.

00:15:24.012 --> 00:15:25.013
Why aren't we?

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.390
I don't know.

00:15:28.433 --> 00:15:29.935
Are we where I think we are?

00:15:30.686 --> 00:15:32.312
I would say yes...

00:15:33.605 --> 00:15:34.815
but it wasn't like this.

00:15:34.982 --> 00:15:36.191
Janet!

00:15:36.608 --> 00:15:37.609
Mom!

00:15:38.735 --> 00:15:39.736
Janet!

00:15:41.405 --> 00:15:42.406
Mom!

00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:56.628
Do not move.

00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:16.690
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.901
Right now.

00:16:22.487 --> 00:16:24.865
<i>Hope? Hope?</i>

00:16:25.032 --> 00:16:26.950
<i>Hank? Can you hear me?</i>

00:16:28.827 --> 00:16:30.537
<i>-Can anyone hear me?
</i>-Oh, my God.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.081
-It's okay.
-What are we gonna do?

00:16:33.248 --> 00:16:35.042
It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

00:16:35.209 --> 00:16:36.251
We're okay. It's gonna be okay.

00:16:36.418 --> 00:16:37.502
You're saying "okay" too much.

00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:39.838
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

00:16:40.005 --> 00:16:40.881
We're okay.

00:16:41.048 --> 00:16:42.049
We are fine.

00:16:42.216 --> 00:16:44.593
Hey, we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna go home.

00:16:45.677 --> 00:16:46.845
In the meantime, look around.

00:16:47.012 --> 00:16:48.222
It's beautiful.

00:16:48.388 --> 00:16:49.640
All right? We're outside.

00:16:50.432 --> 00:16:52.518
It's like we're camping. We love camping.

00:16:52.684 --> 00:16:53.852
We've never been camping.

00:16:55.312 --> 00:16:56.688
But we've always talked about it.

00:17:01.485 --> 00:17:03.237
Is that sun moving?

00:17:14.206 --> 00:17:15.207
Get back!

00:17:19.962 --> 00:17:20.837
Oh, my God.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.422
I don't think this is a sun!

00:17:24.257 --> 00:17:25.258
It's fine.

00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:27.469
-Dad!
-Honey, it's okay.

00:17:27.636 --> 00:17:28.637
Still okay.

00:17:37.437 --> 00:17:38.939
Dad. Oh, my God.

00:17:39.106 --> 00:17:40.107
That was weird.

00:17:45.487 --> 00:17:46.488
Run.

00:18:15.017 --> 00:18:18.395
There's Quantum people in the Quantum Realm?

00:18:18.562 --> 00:18:19.563
Yeah.

00:18:20.397 --> 00:18:21.815
I didn't know that either.

00:18:26.069 --> 00:18:27.321
What was that back there, Mom?

00:18:27.487 --> 00:18:29.114
What was that ship looking for?

00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:30.991
Keep your voice down.

00:18:31.158 --> 00:18:33.243
You said there was nothing down here.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.745
Why didn't you tell us about all of this?

00:18:34.912 --> 00:18:36.538
Hope, I will explain everything,
but right now...

00:18:36.705 --> 00:18:38.540
-I just need you to trust me.
-Then make me trust you!

00:18:38.707 --> 00:18:41.251
Let's just calm down, all right?
We can talk about this...

00:18:41.418 --> 00:18:43.503
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:44.880
No, you need to tell us what's...

00:18:45.047 --> 00:18:47.424
Why didn't you listen?
I told you to stay away from here.

00:18:48.175 --> 00:18:50.344
Janet, I'm so sorry.

00:18:51.178 --> 00:18:53.805
I should have told you what we were doing.
I had no idea...

00:18:53.972 --> 00:18:54.973
I know. It's...

00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:57.309
We'll talk later.

00:18:57.476 --> 00:18:59.269
Right now, we stick together...

00:19:00.103 --> 00:19:01.605
we find Scott and Cassie...

00:19:02.356 --> 00:19:03.857
and we go home. Okay?

00:19:04.274 --> 00:19:05.359
-Okay?
-Okay?

00:19:05.526 --> 00:19:06.527
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:19:06.693 --> 00:19:07.694
Stay close.

00:19:15.118 --> 00:19:16.453
This is incredible.

00:19:17.162 --> 00:19:19.456
I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.

00:19:21.708 --> 00:19:23.001
Why didn't I see any of this?

00:19:23.627 --> 00:19:25.546
You weren't able to look deep enough.

00:19:25.712 --> 00:19:28.173
Not through the Void and Subatomica.

00:19:29.508 --> 00:19:31.260
There are worlds here...

00:19:31.426 --> 00:19:33.136
worlds within worlds.

00:19:34.388 --> 00:19:37.891
It's a place outside time and space.

00:19:39.768 --> 00:19:41.854
It's a secret universe...

00:19:42.187 --> 00:19:43.814
beneath ours.

00:20:05.085 --> 00:20:06.879
Hey, get your hands off me!

00:20:13.844 --> 00:20:14.845
Cassie?

00:20:17.598 --> 00:20:18.640
Where's my daughter?

00:20:20.684 --> 00:20:21.810
Where is she?

00:20:22.895 --> 00:20:23.896
Cassie?

00:20:27.858 --> 00:20:28.859
Where's my daughter?

00:20:32.487 --> 00:20:33.488
Cassie!

00:20:36.158 --> 00:20:37.159
Dad!

00:20:37.993 --> 00:20:38.994
Cassie!

00:20:39.578 --> 00:20:41.121
Drink the ooze.

00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:43.540
What?

00:21:05.646 --> 00:21:06.855
I'll handle this.

00:21:21.203 --> 00:21:22.120
Mom.

00:22:15.966 --> 00:22:18.135
Was that a good stab?

00:22:18.719 --> 00:22:20.053
I got us a ride.

00:22:39.281 --> 00:22:40.407
He's friendly.

00:22:40.908 --> 00:22:42.409
Quite a ride.

00:22:42.576 --> 00:22:45.495
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

00:22:45.662 --> 00:22:46.580
I like ants.

00:22:46.747 --> 00:22:49.041
And I love that you love them. Here.

00:22:49.875 --> 00:22:52.085
These will help us blend in.

00:22:52.836 --> 00:22:55.756
Where exactly are we going on this?

00:22:55.923 --> 00:22:57.674
We're not too far from an old friend of mine.

00:22:57.841 --> 00:22:59.718
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are...

00:23:00.677 --> 00:23:01.803
it'll be him.

00:23:02.679 --> 00:23:03.680
After you.

00:23:05.432 --> 00:23:06.808
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

00:23:12.272 --> 00:23:14.274
Let me go! Let me go!

00:23:25.452 --> 00:23:26.954
I don't know what you're saying!

00:23:27.746 --> 00:23:28.956
I don't know what you...

00:23:47.766 --> 00:23:48.851
No! No!

00:23:58.443 --> 00:24:00.070
Drink the ooze!

00:24:00.237 --> 00:24:01.572
Drink the ooze!

00:24:01.947 --> 00:24:03.615
Drink the ooze!

00:24:03.782 --> 00:24:05.117
Drink the ooze!

00:24:06.869 --> 00:24:07.786
Hello.

00:24:07.953 --> 00:24:08.871
Hi. Hi.

00:24:09.037 --> 00:24:10.455
Did you drink the ooze?

00:24:12.124 --> 00:24:13.417
Why can I understand you?

00:24:13.709 --> 00:24:14.668
Great. That's the ooze.

00:24:14.835 --> 00:24:16.712
Hey, everybody, it worked! Ooze worked!

00:24:20.465 --> 00:24:21.842
We can finally be friends.

00:24:21.925 --> 00:24:23.177
Hi. I am Veb.

00:24:23.343 --> 00:24:24.303
You just drank me.

00:24:24.469 --> 00:24:25.679
I did... What?

00:24:25.846 --> 00:24:26.972
Do you need some more ooze? Here.

00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:29.057
-I can pour some ooze into your hole...
-No, I'm okay.

00:24:29.224 --> 00:24:30.767
-I'm okay. I'm okay.
-Oh, wow!

00:24:30.934 --> 00:24:32.352
A big hole.

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:34.188
How many holes do you have?

00:24:34.897 --> 00:24:36.190
I'm sorry. Is that a personal question?

00:24:36.356 --> 00:24:37.941
I don't have any holes.

00:24:38.108 --> 00:24:40.152
His name is Scott Lang.

00:24:41.278 --> 00:24:42.571
He has seven holes.

00:24:47.492 --> 00:24:48.577
Yeah, that's right.

00:24:48.744 --> 00:24:50.495
How did you know that?

00:24:50.662 --> 00:24:52.664
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:56.043
You can read minds?

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.296
Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.

00:24:59.463 --> 00:25:02.466
Everyone is disgusting.

00:25:04.343 --> 00:25:06.303
-Could you please stop thinking that?
-Sorry.

00:25:07.221 --> 00:25:08.680
-Please, stop.
-Thinking?

00:25:09.723 --> 00:25:11.183
-Thinking that.
-I'm trying.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.561
Well, not very hard.
And I think you look weird too.

00:25:14.728 --> 00:25:16.230
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

00:25:16.396 --> 00:25:17.648
I wish my head glowed.

00:25:18.732 --> 00:25:19.733
No, no, you don't.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.319
I know I don't. I'm nervous, okay?
And it just came out.

00:25:22.486 --> 00:25:23.362
What are you doing here?

00:25:23.529 --> 00:25:25.447
-Are you a spy?
-What? No. No, no.

00:25:25.614 --> 00:25:26.573
We should torture him.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:27.658
Guys. No, it's okay.

00:25:27.824 --> 00:25:30.536
We're not spies. He's my dad.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.081
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

00:25:34.498 --> 00:25:38.210
Then who is San Francisco?

00:25:38.377 --> 00:25:39.920
-It's where we're from.
-It's a place.

00:25:40.087 --> 00:25:41.046
Then what's Earth?

00:25:41.213 --> 00:25:42.047
It's also where we're from.

00:25:42.214 --> 00:25:43.215
We should torture them.

00:25:43.382 --> 00:25:45.509
Why are you always trying to torture people?
We have other options.

00:25:45.676 --> 00:25:48.470
Do things come out of your holes,
like milk, juice...

00:25:48.637 --> 00:25:51.098
Veb, stop asking about his holes.

00:25:51.265 --> 00:25:52.307
Some of us have holes.

00:25:52.474 --> 00:25:53.892
What are you doing here?

00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:55.727
Where are you from?

00:25:56.353 --> 00:25:57.688
-Okay.
-Up there. Up there.

00:25:57.855 --> 00:26:00.816
-See, above this, it's a different universe.
-The Earth. Big Earth.

00:26:00.983 --> 00:26:03.068
-It's the same universe, but it's bigger.
-This is Earth, but it's a very small Earth.

00:26:03.235 --> 00:26:05.070
-Sometimes, I guess.
-I get big. I shrink.

00:26:05.237 --> 00:26:07.114
-And it's like...
-But I wrote a book about it, actually.

00:26:07.281 --> 00:26:08.156
-I don't know.
-This is the Quantum Realm.

00:26:08.323 --> 00:26:09.533
You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.493
-We shrunk. Right now, we're really small.
-It's bigger where we're from.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.453
-So, we're small right now.
-It's bigger.

00:26:17.124 --> 00:26:19.251
Okay, they're telling the truth.

00:26:19.418 --> 00:26:20.294
It doesn't matter.

00:26:23.171 --> 00:26:24.923
You come from above.

00:26:26.175 --> 00:26:27.176
Like him.

00:26:29.178 --> 00:26:31.305
So, he is hunting you.

00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:34.600
He will burn the world to find you.

00:26:35.517 --> 00:26:36.518
Who?

00:26:38.353 --> 00:26:39.438
The Conqueror.

00:27:42.251 --> 00:27:45.921
There are beings down here.
Intelligent beings.

00:27:46.088 --> 00:27:49.049
I always theorized it was possible,
but to be here...

00:27:50.175 --> 00:27:52.302
a subatomic universe.

00:27:52.469 --> 00:27:54.930
This changes everything we know about life...

00:27:55.097 --> 00:27:57.516
evolution, our place in the galaxy...

00:27:57.683 --> 00:27:59.393
Holy shit!

00:27:59.893 --> 00:28:01.436
That guy looks like broccoli.

00:28:10.863 --> 00:28:12.155
Keep your head down.

00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:05.292
Follow me.

00:29:18.722 --> 00:29:19.723
Drink those.

00:29:20.432 --> 00:29:21.767
I'll be right back.

00:29:36.323 --> 00:29:37.407
I'm here for Krylar.

00:29:42.412 --> 00:29:43.372
It's you.

00:29:43.705 --> 00:29:44.873
Let's keep that between us.

00:29:46.124 --> 00:29:47.501
And Krylar.

00:29:47.668 --> 00:29:48.669
Hello.

00:29:49.878 --> 00:29:51.630
I don't know your ways or customs...

00:29:51.797 --> 00:29:55.342
but I assume that you have a beverage
that can get me drunk?

00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:56.552
Absolutely, sir.

00:29:59.555 --> 00:30:01.932
So, what's your story then?

00:30:03.392 --> 00:30:04.393
God.

00:30:05.936 --> 00:30:06.937
Move.

00:30:07.354 --> 00:30:08.355
It's time.

00:30:08.897 --> 00:30:09.898
Follow me.

00:30:16.655 --> 00:30:17.865
Right this way.

00:30:23.537 --> 00:30:25.873
How exactly do you know this guy?

00:30:26.039 --> 00:30:29.209
Old freedom fighter friend of mine.

00:30:29.376 --> 00:30:31.378
Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?

00:30:31.545 --> 00:30:32.588
Or terrorist.

00:30:32.754 --> 00:30:34.798
Depends on who you ask.

00:30:34.965 --> 00:30:38.343
But, trust me, he can help.

00:31:20.344 --> 00:31:22.971
Janet Van Dyne?

00:31:24.765 --> 00:31:26.517
I thought you were dead.

00:31:27.142 --> 00:31:29.019
Been a long time, Krylar.

00:31:29.186 --> 00:31:32.439
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

00:31:32.606 --> 00:31:34.942
I fought like hell against that.

00:31:35.484 --> 00:31:37.110
It sounds so elitist.

00:31:38.195 --> 00:31:41.031
You have got to be Hank.

00:31:41.532 --> 00:31:44.952
I've heard so much about you and your ants.

00:31:45.118 --> 00:31:47.287
What are ants anyway?

00:31:47.454 --> 00:31:48.830
Do we have 'em down here?

00:31:48.997 --> 00:31:50.624
I don't think so. No.

00:31:51.667 --> 00:31:52.793
That's too bad.

00:31:54.002 --> 00:31:55.003
Hope.

00:31:55.754 --> 00:31:57.422
You have to be Hope.

00:31:57.965 --> 00:32:00.217
She talked about you every day.

00:32:00.384 --> 00:32:01.718
That's strange...

00:32:02.302 --> 00:32:04.054
she never said anything about you.

00:32:06.598 --> 00:32:08.684
I don't think I would have told
my kid either.

00:32:09.685 --> 00:32:11.186
-Wild stuff.
-Funny.

00:32:12.062 --> 00:32:12.855
How wild?

00:32:14.231 --> 00:32:16.441
Very wild, Henry. Yeah.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.113
Krylar, we need your help.

00:32:21.446 --> 00:32:25.242
Janet, after all we've been through,
together...

00:32:25.534 --> 00:32:26.493
just ask me.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.161
Tell me, how can I help?

00:32:28.328 --> 00:32:29.621
But...

00:32:29.788 --> 00:32:32.833
is anyone starving? I'm starving.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.126
Boys...

00:32:34.877 --> 00:32:35.878
Now.

00:32:43.886 --> 00:32:45.262
They don't know anything.

00:32:45.721 --> 00:32:48.515
About... anything.

00:32:48.682 --> 00:32:49.683
Then get them out of here.

00:32:51.643 --> 00:32:52.686
Excuse me.

00:32:52.853 --> 00:32:54.980
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

00:32:55.147 --> 00:32:56.523
We're just trying to find our family.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:57.816
Do you have a map?

00:32:57.983 --> 00:32:59.234
All we wanna do is go...

00:33:02.237 --> 00:33:03.280
Wait, wait. Don't shoot.

00:33:03.447 --> 00:33:04.573
They're with us.

00:33:06.491 --> 00:33:07.868
Is that building alive?

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:09.620
Yours are dead?

00:33:13.123 --> 00:33:14.124
Look. Excuse me.

00:33:14.291 --> 00:33:15.792
We just wanna go home.

00:33:19.963 --> 00:33:22.049
At least you still have a home.

00:33:29.806 --> 00:33:31.350
What happened here?

00:33:31.934 --> 00:33:34.645
The Conqueror burned our homes.

00:33:35.395 --> 00:33:37.064
Our stories.

00:33:38.023 --> 00:33:41.318
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

00:33:42.402 --> 00:33:43.987
Some of us escaped...

00:33:44.321 --> 00:33:45.906
found others on the run.

00:33:46.907 --> 00:33:48.534
We gathered who we could to fight.

00:33:49.243 --> 00:33:50.786
It was never enough.

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:53.288
I'm sorry.

00:33:54.164 --> 00:33:55.165
We can help.

00:34:00.963 --> 00:34:03.173
-Cassie...
-Dad, you're an Avenger.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.258
They need help.

00:34:04.424 --> 00:34:06.343
No. What I need to do is get you home.

00:34:06.802 --> 00:34:07.970
Why don't you wanna help?

00:34:08.135 --> 00:34:09.346
We don't know anything about this place.

00:34:09.512 --> 00:34:11.222
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:12.558
Have we been gone for 10 seconds?

00:34:12.724 --> 00:34:13.724
Or have we been gone for 10 years?

00:34:13.892 --> 00:34:15.018
Think about your mom right now.

00:34:15.184 --> 00:34:17.354
-Can you imagine what she must be...
-Don't use Mom as an excuse.

00:34:17.521 --> 00:34:19.606
-You just don't care.
-No, I do care.

00:34:19.773 --> 00:34:21.441
I know you wanna help. I do.

00:34:21.608 --> 00:34:23.402
But this is not our fight.

00:34:23.777 --> 00:34:26.445
Just 'cause it's not happening to you
doesn't mean it's not happening.

00:34:27.948 --> 00:34:28.949
Hey.

00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:33.287
Would you look at me?

00:34:35.581 --> 00:34:37.082
She's disappointed in you.

00:34:37.249 --> 00:34:38.709
I got that. Yeah. Thank you.

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:39.710
You're welcome.

00:34:39.876 --> 00:34:40.961
We'll talk about it later.

00:34:41.128 --> 00:34:42.796
Right now, let's just find the others.

00:34:43.297 --> 00:34:45.215
No one knows this place
better than Janet.

00:34:47.593 --> 00:34:48.510
What did you say?

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.095
What?

00:34:50.262 --> 00:34:51.471
That name.

00:34:52.597 --> 00:34:54.141
Janet Van Dyne.

00:34:54.308 --> 00:34:55.267
Where is she?

00:34:55.434 --> 00:34:57.186
That's what we're trying to find out.
You know her?

00:34:57.686 --> 00:34:58.896
I know her.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.481
She shouldn't be here.

00:35:03.442 --> 00:35:05.235
Hey, bring a round of the chasers, please.

00:35:05.903 --> 00:35:06.945
Yes, thank you.

00:35:07.112 --> 00:35:10.199
If you haven't had this, don't try it...

00:35:10.699 --> 00:35:12.784
unless you want to change your life.

00:35:24.087 --> 00:35:27.591
Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.

00:35:28.592 --> 00:35:29.843
Two of them.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.303
Human, like us.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:33.096
Human, that's the word.

00:35:33.263 --> 00:35:36.350
Totally forgot what you call yourselves
up there.

00:35:36.517 --> 00:35:37.518
Human.

00:35:38.185 --> 00:35:40.187
Are you not human?

00:35:40.354 --> 00:35:42.356
Not technically, but yes.

00:35:42.981 --> 00:35:44.358
In the ways that matter.

00:35:48.987 --> 00:35:49.988
No!

00:35:53.534 --> 00:35:54.868
Let us talk.

00:35:57.829 --> 00:36:02.084
So, what is it that brings you to us, Janet?

00:36:03.502 --> 00:36:05.921
If I remember correctly, you left.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.383
You left all of us.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.260
With him.

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:14.763
Janet, what is he talking about?

00:36:16.723 --> 00:36:19.560
You didn't tell them about him.

00:36:22.521 --> 00:36:24.106
Did you say anything...

00:36:25.023 --> 00:36:26.233
about what you did here?

00:36:28.569 --> 00:36:30.737
How many people died because of you?

00:36:35.784 --> 00:36:38.161
Does your family even know who you are?

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:43.000
Your mommy...

00:36:44.459 --> 00:36:46.295
is full of secrets.

00:36:46.461 --> 00:36:47.546
You're lying.

00:36:47.713 --> 00:36:48.839
I lie.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.175
A lot.

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.596
Not about this.

00:36:57.389 --> 00:36:58.682
Let them go.

00:37:00.434 --> 00:37:02.477
He just wants me.

00:37:02.644 --> 00:37:04.021
But you want them.

00:37:05.397 --> 00:37:06.982
So they're coming too.

00:37:08.233 --> 00:37:11.278
Along with those other friends of yours.

00:37:12.779 --> 00:37:14.531
I heard about them.

00:37:14.698 --> 00:37:16.909
But he did too.

00:37:18.702 --> 00:37:20.329
And he sent the Hunter.

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.497
What kind of hunter?

00:37:23.749 --> 00:37:25.876
Not a man. Not a machine.

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:29.922
A mechanized organism designed only...

00:37:30.088 --> 00:37:31.798
for killing.

00:37:33.926 --> 00:37:35.219
Where are they?

00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:36.678
No clue.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:38.931
Dead.

00:37:41.266 --> 00:37:42.518
Probably dead.

00:37:55.489 --> 00:37:59.034
This is so sad when all of this...

00:37:59.201 --> 00:38:00.744
could have been avoided, Janet.

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:04.039
Just give him what he wants.

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:08.710
What happened to you?

00:38:11.421 --> 00:38:14.508
We fought against him.

00:38:16.593 --> 00:38:18.470
He can be very persuasive.

00:38:20.764 --> 00:38:22.057
Let's pay him a visit.

00:38:26.144 --> 00:38:27.521
I think we're done here.

00:38:45.455 --> 00:38:46.748
Can that ship get us out of here?

00:38:49.459 --> 00:38:50.210
Cover me?

00:38:50.377 --> 00:38:51.461
Always.

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:24.494
Henry, take the helm.

00:39:25.495 --> 00:39:26.663
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

00:39:30.751 --> 00:39:32.377
Where are the controls?

00:39:32.878 --> 00:39:34.171
Those are the controls.

00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:39.009
What the hell?

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:41.053
You'll be great. It's like flying a bike.

00:39:43.388 --> 00:39:45.390
Is the bike alive?

00:39:58.946 --> 00:40:00.614
Hands, all the way in!

00:40:01.615 --> 00:40:02.741
Like stuffing a turkey.

00:40:10.707 --> 00:40:12.834
-Really, him?
-He used to be charming.

00:40:13.001 --> 00:40:13.752
That guy?

00:40:13.919 --> 00:40:15.754
I was down here for 30 years, Henry.

00:40:15.921 --> 00:40:17.631
-I had needs.
-Oh, my God.

00:40:17.798 --> 00:40:19.591
Look, I get it. I've got needs too.

00:40:19.758 --> 00:40:20.759
Oh, my God!

00:40:20.926 --> 00:40:23.011
I had dinner with someone a few times.

00:40:23.595 --> 00:40:25.055
Her name was Linda.

00:40:26.014 --> 00:40:27.015
It didn't work out.

00:40:27.182 --> 00:40:28.433
What went wrong?

00:40:28.892 --> 00:40:30.477
She wasn't you, baby.

00:40:33.856 --> 00:40:36.775
-Get everyone in the ships. We're leaving.
-All right.

00:40:36.942 --> 00:40:38.735
-And, Xolum.
-Right here.

00:40:38.902 --> 00:40:41.113
Take them as far away from here as you can.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.322
-Why?
-What?

00:40:42.489 --> 00:40:45.659
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

00:40:54.126 --> 00:40:55.878
You led them straight to us.

00:40:56.628 --> 00:40:57.754
Come on, come on.

00:40:58.505 --> 00:40:59.840
Take as many as you can.

00:41:00.007 --> 00:41:01.216
We'll hold them off.

00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:25.449
Go!

00:41:27.075 --> 00:41:28.493
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

00:41:29.161 --> 00:41:30.621
We gotta go! We gotta go!

00:41:30.787 --> 00:41:31.830
Get on. Get on now!

00:41:31.997 --> 00:41:33.248
We have to go now. Now!

00:41:51.225 --> 00:41:52.226
Oh, my God!

00:42:09.993 --> 00:42:11.328
Cassie, let's go!

00:42:18.544 --> 00:42:19.836
Get to the sanctuary.

00:42:20.587 --> 00:42:21.672
Wait for my message.

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:24.091
-Veb, we're leaving.
-No. No, wait!

00:42:24.258 --> 00:42:26.301
-Move! Move!
-All my friends.

00:42:48.615 --> 00:42:49.700
<i>Give up the travelers.</i>

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:51.159
<i>The Conqueror will show you mercy.</i>

00:42:51.326 --> 00:42:52.703
I know his mercy.

00:43:06.341 --> 00:43:07.426
Stay here. I'm...

00:43:08.677 --> 00:43:09.678
Cassie?

00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:12.389
Oh, no.

00:43:35.537 --> 00:43:37.039
Okay. I have a suit.

00:43:37.539 --> 00:43:38.957
Yeah, I noticed.

00:43:39.666 --> 00:43:41.001
-You okay?
-Yes.

00:43:42.669 --> 00:43:44.004
Look, momentum, right?

00:43:44.171 --> 00:43:46.089
Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:47.341
I know how to do it, Dad.

00:43:47.508 --> 00:43:48.509
-Do you? Really?
-Yes.

00:43:48.675 --> 00:43:49.843
'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:51.303
I messed up on the timing.

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:52.304
Jump...

00:43:57.935 --> 00:43:58.810
Like that.

00:43:58.977 --> 00:44:00.395
You see what I did? You see what I did?

00:44:00.979 --> 00:44:02.606
No. You're like this small.

00:44:02.981 --> 00:44:03.982
I jumped and tapped.

00:44:14.701 --> 00:44:16.203
Jentorra, we have to go.

00:44:37.391 --> 00:44:38.559
Get to the ship!

00:45:26.481 --> 00:45:29.193
<i>Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott.</i>

00:45:29.943 --> 00:45:32.529
<i>I've been waiting a long time for this.</i>

00:45:33.238 --> 00:45:34.323
What?

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.034
Is someone in there?

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:39.161
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

00:45:39.328 --> 00:45:41.914
<i>The destiny you cannot escape.</i>

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.209
<i>Our fates have always been forged together...</i>

00:45:47.502 --> 00:45:49.379
<i>ever since that day we met.</i>

00:45:51.798 --> 00:45:53.217
Scott Lang.

00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:54.468
Get away from us!

00:45:54.635 --> 00:45:56.178
<i>The day you broke me.</i>

00:45:59.348 --> 00:46:01.225
<i>-Banished me down here.
-Wait.</i>

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.561
Darren?

00:46:06.355 --> 00:46:07.856
Surprised to see me?

00:46:09.775 --> 00:46:10.859
Yeah.

00:46:11.026 --> 00:46:12.152
It's the bee guy?

00:46:12.611 --> 00:46:14.363
-It's the bee guy?
-Cassie?

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.198
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:46:17.115 --> 00:46:18.742
How are you not dead?

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:20.827
I became the ultimate weapon.

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.164
That's what this is?

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.291
Look, Darren.

00:46:30.462 --> 00:46:31.713
Darren is dead!

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.384
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

00:46:36.552 --> 00:46:38.554
And there's no place you can run, Scott.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.847
Not from me.

00:46:40.472 --> 00:46:42.099
And not from him.

00:46:43.141 --> 00:46:45.310
He's the future.

00:46:46.061 --> 00:46:47.187
He's the past.

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:51.233
And now all he needs is you.

00:46:57.531 --> 00:46:58.657
Mom?

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:00.826
What's after Scott and Cassie?

00:47:02.703 --> 00:47:04.162
We have to find them.

00:47:05.247 --> 00:47:06.957
There's something I have to do first.

00:47:07.124 --> 00:47:08.542
They could be dead!

00:47:08.709 --> 00:47:10.168
Hope, please.

00:47:10.377 --> 00:47:11.962
And you're still hiding things from us.

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:14.423
I am trying to protect you.

00:47:15.007 --> 00:47:16.008
From what?

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:20.512
Who are you so afraid of?

00:47:33.066 --> 00:47:34.443
Third time in jail?

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:37.613
Four.

00:47:46.413 --> 00:47:48.415
<i>And here we are again.</i>

00:47:49.458 --> 00:47:51.043
Face to face.

00:47:53.629 --> 00:47:55.047
That's a face.

00:47:56.465 --> 00:47:57.674
It's a big face.

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.426
Why are you just a floating head?

00:47:59.593 --> 00:48:01.678
Maybe you could walk us through this, Darren.

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:04.765
You left Darren to die in the Quantum Realm.

00:48:06.225 --> 00:48:08.393
<i>But the Conqueror found me.</i>

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.103
<i>Rebuilt me.</i>

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.314
<i>Made me the ultimate weapon.</i>

00:48:12.981 --> 00:48:15.776
<i>A mechanized organism designed
only for...</i>

00:48:15.943 --> 00:48:16.944
M.O.D.O.K.?

00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:21.365
I get it. It's an acronym.

00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:22.699
It's an acronym.

00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:25.869
Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

00:48:27.287 --> 00:48:28.914
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:32.501
-I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.
-Just now noticing the baby legs.

00:48:33.252 --> 00:48:34.253
They're not baby legs.

00:48:34.419 --> 00:48:35.796
A little bit like a Björn.

00:48:35.963 --> 00:48:37.297
You think you're so smart.

00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:40.592
Scott Lang,
the man who took everything from me.

00:48:40.759 --> 00:48:42.177
Who stole my whole life.

00:48:42.469 --> 00:48:43.470
But I did it.

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.598
I got you here.

00:48:46.765 --> 00:48:48.767
I found your signal, Cassie.

00:48:48.934 --> 00:48:51.520
Thanks for that, by the way.
Couldn't have done it without you.

00:48:54.773 --> 00:48:56.775
You're looking at a man set free.

00:48:57.776 --> 00:49:01.446
I've created so much more here
than you could possibly imagine.

00:49:02.614 --> 00:49:05.242
All for him.

00:49:07.995 --> 00:49:11.081
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

00:49:14.459 --> 00:49:16.169
What is this place?

00:49:17.462 --> 00:49:19.339
<i>He said he was a traveler.</i>

00:49:19.631 --> 00:49:22.551
A scientist who crashed off course.

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:31.727
<i>He had a ship...</i>

00:49:32.603 --> 00:49:35.272
beyond anything I had ever seen.

00:49:35.856 --> 00:49:38.984
<i>A ship that could travel the Multiverse.</i>

00:49:39.151 --> 00:49:40.360
The Multiverse?

00:49:41.361 --> 00:49:43.906
As in alternate dimensions?

00:49:44.072 --> 00:49:45.908
Parallel realities?

00:49:46.074 --> 00:49:47.701
I didn't believe it at first.

00:49:49.912 --> 00:49:50.913
But it's real.

00:49:52.706 --> 00:49:54.124
<i>Just like we theorized.</i>

00:49:56.668 --> 00:49:58.378
Can this take us home?

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:01.757
It can take you anywhere.

00:50:20.943 --> 00:50:22.819
<i>I'd never met anyone like him.</i>

00:50:25.197 --> 00:50:27.324
<i>He felt so...</i>

00:50:27.741 --> 00:50:28.825
<i>lost.</i>

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:31.745
<i>I guess we both were.</i>

00:50:32.663 --> 00:50:34.081
<i>But we had a way out.</i>

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.460
<i>We tried everything...</i>

00:50:38.627 --> 00:50:41.421
<i>to recharge his ship's energy core.</i>

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.595
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

00:50:50.138 --> 00:50:54.810
<i>But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.</i>

00:50:56.061 --> 00:50:57.521
I lied to Hope.

00:51:02.067 --> 00:51:03.735
I told her I was coming home.

00:51:07.865 --> 00:51:09.741
I can see her by the door.

00:51:12.244 --> 00:51:13.662
Waiting for me.

00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:19.209
That's the last thing I did...

00:51:21.879 --> 00:51:23.046
was lie to her.

00:51:26.884 --> 00:51:28.886
I just thought I'd have more time.

00:51:33.765 --> 00:51:35.184
I can give that to you.

00:51:37.186 --> 00:51:38.187
Time.

00:51:42.107 --> 00:51:43.442
It's not what you think it is.

00:51:47.738 --> 00:51:49.156
It's a cage.

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:52.326
And it does everything it can...

00:51:52.993 --> 00:51:54.077
to break you.

00:51:57.289 --> 00:52:00.542
It's not until you free yourself from it
that you see...

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:03.128
just how small...

00:52:04.129 --> 00:52:05.339
it always was.

00:52:11.136 --> 00:52:13.013
We're going to get out of here.

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:17.768
She's gonna open the door...

00:52:19.353 --> 00:52:20.812
and you'll be there.

00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:26.610
I promise.

00:52:31.198 --> 00:52:33.033
-Let's get to work.
-Okay.

00:52:36.161 --> 00:52:39.081
<i>It took ages, but we did it.</i>

00:52:40.666 --> 00:52:43.043
We brought it back to life.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:46.672
Let's go home.

00:52:51.218 --> 00:52:53.095
<i>His ship was neurokinetic.</i>

00:52:54.263 --> 00:52:55.722
<i>Connected to his thoughts.</i>

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:00.727
<i>When I touched it...</i>

00:53:02.813 --> 00:53:04.565
I saw his mind.

00:53:05.691 --> 00:53:06.692
<i>I felt...</i>

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:09.862
<i>what he had done.</i>

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.492
<i>Entire worlds...</i>

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:18.370
<i>entire timelines.</i>

00:53:18.537 --> 00:53:22.541
<i>Gone, like they never even existed.</i>

00:53:40.976 --> 00:53:41.977
Janet?

00:53:46.773 --> 00:53:47.983
We can leave.

00:53:50.194 --> 00:53:51.195
Right now.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.826
Who is Kang?

00:54:03.165 --> 00:54:04.583
Who I need to be.

00:54:08.921 --> 00:54:10.255
He didn't crash here.

00:54:10.797 --> 00:54:12.466
He was exiled here.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:16.720
Outside space and time.

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:19.556
The only place...

00:54:20.474 --> 00:54:22.100
that could hold him.

00:54:23.227 --> 00:54:24.603
Exiled?

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:26.730
By who?

00:54:27.105 --> 00:54:28.106
I don't know.

00:54:30.609 --> 00:54:32.402
But they sabotaged his ship.

00:54:33.695 --> 00:54:35.447
And trapped him here.

00:54:37.908 --> 00:54:39.284
And because of me...

00:54:40.702 --> 00:54:42.079
he was getting out.

00:54:42.246 --> 00:54:43.080
Janet?

00:54:46.124 --> 00:54:47.417
Stay away.

00:54:53.048 --> 00:54:54.716
You saved my life.

00:55:00.055 --> 00:55:01.390
I made a promise.

00:55:08.355 --> 00:55:09.982
Just let me take you home.

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:12.818
And then?

00:55:14.987 --> 00:55:16.738
What are you going to do?

00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:29.418
Win.

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:51.190
I told you time isn't what you think.

00:55:53.317 --> 00:55:54.985
I can make it...

00:55:55.777 --> 00:55:57.863
so you never left her.

00:55:59.198 --> 00:56:02.409
Hope is going to open the door...

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:05.162
and you'll be there.

00:56:06.163 --> 00:56:08.498
And how many worlds will die...

00:56:09.958 --> 00:56:11.585
if you get out?

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.171
Not yours.

00:56:15.923 --> 00:56:17.549
She'll never know.

00:56:22.304 --> 00:56:24.848
Don't you want to see your daughter again?

00:56:27.184 --> 00:56:28.727
I can't let you leave.

00:56:31.188 --> 00:56:33.190
Why do you think you can stop me?

00:56:51.166 --> 00:56:52.543
Give it to me, Janet.

00:56:54.002 --> 00:56:55.128
Give it to me!

00:56:55.587 --> 00:56:58.549
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

00:56:59.424 --> 00:57:00.425
What did you do?

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:06.431
I'm sorry, Hope.

00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:09.977
No!

00:57:37.212 --> 00:57:38.922
<i>I blew up his core.</i>

00:57:39.131 --> 00:57:41.300
<i>Cut him off from time.</i>

00:57:41.717 --> 00:57:44.636
<i>And trapped us both down here forever.</i>

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.599
But I gave him back enough.

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.392
Now that he had his suit back...

00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:53.937
he became what he always was.

00:57:54.855 --> 00:57:56.523
<i>A conqueror.</i>

00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:59.276
<i>He's got weapons and technology...</i>

00:57:59.443 --> 00:58:03.113
<i>centuries beyond anything we can dream of.</i>

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:07.743
<i>He took his prison and made it his empire.</i>

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:12.039
I spent years fighting him...

00:58:12.206 --> 00:58:14.791
running from him, hiding from him.

00:58:16.501 --> 00:58:17.920
And then you saved me.

00:58:21.256 --> 00:58:22.257
You brought me home.

00:58:24.176 --> 00:58:25.219
But I didn't deserve it.

00:58:27.012 --> 00:58:30.599
I unleashed a monster on this place...

00:58:30.766 --> 00:58:32.601
and ran away.

00:58:33.018 --> 00:58:36.438
Janet, you couldn't have known.

00:58:38.607 --> 00:58:40.567
I'm sorry I never told you.

00:58:41.652 --> 00:58:43.529
I just wanted to forget.

00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:47.366
I just wanted to be your mom again.

00:58:52.746 --> 00:58:55.707
I'm so sorry you had to go through
all of that alone.

00:58:56.667 --> 00:58:59.294
But you are not alone now.

00:59:02.965 --> 00:59:04.383
We'll stop him together.

00:59:05.425 --> 00:59:06.885
He's after the core.

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:10.389
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

00:59:10.556 --> 00:59:13.934
And if he's got Scott and Cassie,
he's got Pym Particles.

00:59:14.101 --> 00:59:15.936
-And a head start.
-Exactly.

00:59:16.103 --> 00:59:17.729
-We gotta get out of here.
-Hope.

00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:19.898
He cannot get out.

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:42.921
You're an interesting man...

00:59:46.592 --> 00:59:48.010
Scott Lang.

00:59:49.678 --> 00:59:50.888
I don't know who you are...

00:59:52.264 --> 00:59:53.849
but you've made a big mistake.

00:59:54.474 --> 00:59:55.517
Okay?

00:59:56.476 --> 00:59:57.978
I'm an Avenger.

00:59:58.812 --> 01:00:00.189
I've called the other Avengers...

01:00:00.647 --> 01:00:01.899
You're an Avenger?

01:00:04.193 --> 01:00:06.069
Have I killed you before?

01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:08.030
What?

01:00:08.864 --> 01:00:10.782
They all blur together after a while.

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:14.661
You're not the one with the hammer?

01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:16.163
No, that's Thor.

01:00:18.123 --> 01:00:19.124
We get confused a lot.

01:00:19.291 --> 01:00:21.501
Similar body types.
Who are you?

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:25.047
Just a man...

01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:27.716
who's lost a lot of time.

01:00:27.883 --> 01:00:29.051
Like you.

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:33.430
But we can help each other with that.

01:00:35.224 --> 01:00:37.434
M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief.

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:39.895
Yeah, he stole something from me.

01:00:41.563 --> 01:00:43.899
Do not speak when I am in the room.

01:00:51.823 --> 01:00:54.284
Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.

01:00:54.993 --> 01:00:56.328
You know Janet too?

01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:59.790
Does everyone down here know Janet?

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.709
She didn't tell you about me?

01:01:07.297 --> 01:01:08.966
I guess that's not a surprise.

01:01:11.593 --> 01:01:13.679
Janet stole something from me.

01:01:14.596 --> 01:01:17.224
My ticket out of here.

01:01:19.935 --> 01:01:22.855
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:24.773
And why would I do that?

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:27.442
Because you want to get out of here.

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:32.197
And I need to get out of here.

01:01:34.533 --> 01:01:36.368
Because I know how it ends.

01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:38.245
How what ends?

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.958
All of it.

01:01:46.378 --> 01:01:49.506
I don't live in a straight line.

01:01:52.259 --> 01:01:53.802
And with time...

01:01:54.761 --> 01:01:55.888
it's hard...

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:58.056
not to skip to the end.

01:01:59.808 --> 01:02:02.019
So, if you want to stop what's coming...

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:05.063
and trust me...

01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:06.481
you do...

01:02:08.775 --> 01:02:10.903
I am the only shot you have.

01:02:11.612 --> 01:02:12.738
What's coming?

01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:15.866
Me.

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:20.412
A lot of me.

01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:28.420
They exiled me, down here.

01:02:31.673 --> 01:02:33.342
They're afraid of me.

01:02:39.306 --> 01:02:42.518
But I'm the man who can get you home.

01:02:52.903 --> 01:02:54.404
So, do we have a deal?

01:02:57.783 --> 01:02:59.701
No, I don't think we do.

01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:10.045
Dad!

01:03:10.212 --> 01:03:12.506
Let me make this easy for you.

01:03:12.673 --> 01:03:14.383
You will bring me what I need...

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:16.844
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you...

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:19.096
then make you relive that moment...

01:03:19.263 --> 01:03:22.558
over and over again in time, endlessly...

01:03:22.724 --> 01:03:25.185
until you beg me to kill you.

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:27.855
Do we understand?

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:32.609
Don't do this.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.657
I'm a man who likes to be understood.

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:42.911
Dad.

01:03:44.079 --> 01:03:45.038
Don't listen to him.

01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:48.667
No! No!

01:03:48.834 --> 01:03:49.877
Look, we can talk about this.

01:03:50.335 --> 01:03:51.461
Don't do it!

01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:53.088
You really should do it.

01:03:53.255 --> 01:03:54.256
Please.

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:58.135
That's my daughter, please.

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:00.762
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

01:04:00.929 --> 01:04:01.930
Please!

01:04:02.097 --> 01:04:03.348
You think I'm lying?

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:06.185
Do I look like a liar to you?

01:04:07.936 --> 01:04:08.937
Stop!

01:04:09.104 --> 01:04:10.606
-Dad!
-I'll do it. I'll do it.

01:04:10.772 --> 01:04:12.316
I'll do it. Just let her go.

01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:14.026
Let her go. Let her go!

01:04:24.953 --> 01:04:26.205
You're out of your league.

01:04:28.248 --> 01:04:29.249
Ant-Man.

01:04:35.506 --> 01:04:37.299
Just be glad I need you.

01:04:50.562 --> 01:04:53.982
Don't touch her again.

01:04:54.441 --> 01:04:56.026
Then give me what I need.

01:04:57.778 --> 01:04:59.029
Where is it?

01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:41.989
What is that?

01:05:42.155 --> 01:05:44.533
It was a multiversal engine core.

01:05:46.201 --> 01:05:49.663
A power source that can take you anywhere
in space and time.

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:53.000
Then Janet blew it up.

01:05:57.337 --> 01:05:58.672
It's in that?

01:05:58.839 --> 01:06:00.716
It is that.

01:06:00.883 --> 01:06:02.926
And we have to get to the center.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.179
That's good to know.

01:06:07.014 --> 01:06:10.225
You'll have to shrink down and
pass through the eye of the storm.

01:06:10.392 --> 01:06:13.020
Once you're inside, find the core...

01:06:13.187 --> 01:06:14.897
and size it back down.

01:06:15.063 --> 01:06:16.523
What does it look like?

01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:18.901
When I steal something,
I usually know what I'm stealing.

01:06:19.067 --> 01:06:20.694
You'll know it when you see it.

01:06:20.861 --> 01:06:23.155
Get in and out as fast as you can.

01:06:23.322 --> 01:06:26.617
The longer you're in there,
the more your mind will come undone.

01:06:29.536 --> 01:06:30.537
Better hurry.

01:06:31.747 --> 01:06:32.706
Dad!

01:06:35.209 --> 01:06:36.543
I'm sorry.

01:06:37.002 --> 01:06:38.545
This is all my fault.

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:41.840
Hey, hey, hey.

01:06:42.216 --> 01:06:43.217
No.

01:06:44.843 --> 01:06:46.053
I messed up.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.554
Cassie.

01:06:48.514 --> 01:06:50.724
My whole life happened because I messed up.

01:06:52.184 --> 01:06:54.811
The only thing I didn't mess up is you.

01:06:58.023 --> 01:06:59.191
Dad!

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.859
It's okay.

01:07:01.026 --> 01:07:02.152
It's okay.

01:07:04.905 --> 01:07:06.365
I love you, Peanut.

01:07:07.574 --> 01:07:09.409
I love you too.

01:07:53.495 --> 01:07:55.163
Okay. I'm in.

01:07:58.458 --> 01:08:00.460
Darren, can you hear me?

01:08:00.627 --> 01:08:01.545
Darren?

01:08:02.754 --> 01:08:03.755
Darren?

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:08.010
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

01:08:08.177 --> 01:08:09.261
<i>What?</i>

01:08:09.636 --> 01:08:11.221
-I'm in.
<i>-Okay.</i>

01:08:11.722 --> 01:08:14.474
Okay, so what do I do? What's the plan?

01:08:15.976 --> 01:08:17.144
<i>Don't die?</i>

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:20.772
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

01:08:20.939 --> 01:08:22.107
<i>Do you see it?</i>

01:08:23.567 --> 01:08:24.734
Yeah. I see it.

01:08:29.948 --> 01:08:31.366
I'm heading in.

01:08:34.745 --> 01:08:35.662
What the hell?

01:08:35.828 --> 01:08:36.705
What the hell?

01:08:36.872 --> 01:08:37.706
What the hell?

01:08:37.873 --> 01:08:40.583
<i>I told you, Scott.
Getting in was just the beginning.</i>

01:08:40.751 --> 01:08:41.877
You never said that.

01:08:42.043 --> 01:08:43.295
Why am I looking at another me?

01:08:43.462 --> 01:08:45.005
I'm not another me. You're another me.

01:08:45.172 --> 01:08:46.089
You just came out...

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:47.882
Why am I looking at another me?

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:51.220
<i>You're looking at the possibility
of another you.</i>

01:08:51.386 --> 01:08:53.138
<i>You're in a Probability Storm.</i>

01:08:53.305 --> 01:08:55.431
What does any of that mean?

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:57.266
-You don't know?
-Why would I know?

01:08:57.434 --> 01:08:58.351
Because you got me in here.

01:08:58.519 --> 01:08:59.728
So, I am the real one, huh?

01:08:59.895 --> 01:09:00.812
No. I didn't say that.

01:09:02.355 --> 01:09:03.607
-What the hell?
-What the hell?

01:09:03.774 --> 01:09:04.690
-What the hell?
-What the hell?

01:09:04.858 --> 01:09:05.900
-Wait. Wait, wait.
-What the hell?

01:09:06.068 --> 01:09:07.109
What the hell?

01:09:08.237 --> 01:09:09.196
What is this place?

01:09:09.363 --> 01:09:11.448
<i>It's a Probability Storm.</i>

01:09:11.949 --> 01:09:14.451
<i>Every choice you could make,
existing all at once.</i>

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:16.036
What is he saying? What's he saying?

01:09:16.411 --> 01:09:18.622
-What's he saying?
<i>-You're inside Schrödinger's box.</i>

01:09:18.788 --> 01:09:19.790
<i>And you're the cat.</i>

01:09:19.957 --> 01:09:21.416
-That doesn't make sense.
-Oh, I get it.

01:09:21.583 --> 01:09:23.292
Nobody move! All right? Nobody move!

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.587
Why should we listen to you?
You're not even the real one.

01:09:25.754 --> 01:09:26.797
-What the hell?
-Am I real?

01:09:26.964 --> 01:09:27.840
-Am I real?
-Am I real?

01:09:28.006 --> 01:09:29.299
-I am the real one!
-What the hell?

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:31.385
What the hell. I'm the real one.

01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:33.053
Guys. Hey, relax.

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:34.888
Take it easy. Breathe.

01:09:35.055 --> 01:09:37.140
We'll figure this out. Together.

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:38.308
Who are you?

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:39.851
Why are you dressed like that?

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:42.312
Because I work at Baskin-Robbins.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.230
This is my uniform.

01:09:44.398 --> 01:09:45.690
These are normal clothes.

01:09:45.858 --> 01:09:47.150
Why are you dressed like that?

01:09:47.234 --> 01:09:48.777
-Do you have ice cream?
-Enough!

01:09:48.944 --> 01:09:49.987
Let's do this!

01:09:58.161 --> 01:09:59.663
Oh, we're all gonna die.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.041
Wait.

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:04.877
Wait. Wait!

01:10:05.043 --> 01:10:06.128
No! No!

01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:08.755
<i>No! Wait! No!</i>

01:10:08.922 --> 01:10:10.257
I've got a read on Scott.

01:10:25.898 --> 01:10:26.857
Out of the way!

01:10:27.024 --> 01:10:29.109
-Mom! What is this?
-What are you doing?

01:10:29.276 --> 01:10:31.028
<i>Don't look at them.
They're just possibilities.</i>

01:10:32.321 --> 01:10:33.614
<i>They're not you.</i>

01:10:33.947 --> 01:10:35.908
Scott, where are you?

01:10:40.162 --> 01:10:41.163
Why am I here?

01:10:42.164 --> 01:10:43.999
<i>Don't worry. It'll work this time.</i>

01:10:44.166 --> 01:10:45.959
What are you... Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.

01:10:46.126 --> 01:10:48.629
-Stop! No!
<i>-I got this, guys.</i>

01:10:54.009 --> 01:10:56.011
<i>I got this!
I got it!</i>

01:11:00.432 --> 01:11:01.642
Scott, where are you?

01:11:02.226 --> 01:11:03.227
Scott!

01:11:06.688 --> 01:11:08.273
Where are you, Scott?

01:11:09.608 --> 01:11:11.443
<i>-I can't breathe.
-Ow, that's my neck.</i>

01:11:13.028 --> 01:11:14.154
<i>Stop kicking me!</i>

01:11:16.823 --> 01:11:18.408
<i>-My back!
-We're all gonna die!</i>

01:11:19.576 --> 01:11:20.577
Dad.

01:11:23.413 --> 01:11:24.665
<i>Come back.</i>

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:26.583
<i>Dad...</i>

01:11:27.376 --> 01:11:28.794
<i>if you can hear me...</i>

01:11:29.378 --> 01:11:31.880
<i>come back.
Just come back.</i>

01:11:32.923 --> 01:11:34.466
<i>-Don't give up.
</i>-Come on.

01:11:35.342 --> 01:11:37.261
<i>-Dad, just come back one more time.
</i>-Come on.

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:39.012
<i>-She needs us.
-Please.</i>

01:11:39.179 --> 01:11:40.764
<i>-Yes, come on.
-Come back.</i>

01:11:40.848 --> 01:11:42.808
<i>She needs us.
Let's do it together.</i>

01:11:42.891 --> 01:11:45.018
<i>-Get him up! Get him up!
-Grab him! Grab him!</i>

01:11:45.102 --> 01:11:46.311
Let's go.

01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:49.231
<i>-Come on, lift him!
</i>-Yes!

01:11:49.398 --> 01:11:51.608
<i>-I got ya, I got ya! Go.
</i>-Come on. That's it.

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:53.610
-Come on!
<i>-Give him a boost! Give him a boost!</i>

01:11:55.821 --> 01:11:58.323
<i>Come on, we're doing it for Cassie!
Fellas, let's go!</i>

01:11:58.490 --> 01:12:00.200
<i>Everyone together!</i>

01:12:00.367 --> 01:12:01.410
What are you doing?

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.704
How are you able to do that?

01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:04.872
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:08.125
We all want the same thing.

01:12:10.043 --> 01:12:11.753
And I'm coming, Cassie.

01:12:20.387 --> 01:12:21.763
Go get her, pal.

01:12:27.144 --> 01:12:28.687
Everyone, let's go!

01:12:31.064 --> 01:12:32.316
Come on!

01:12:40.282 --> 01:12:41.283
Come on, closer.

01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:42.326
<i>Get him higher!</i>

01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:44.161
<i>Hang on, guys, hang on.</i>

01:12:45.454 --> 01:12:46.997
<i>Careful. Steady, steady.</i>

01:12:50.042 --> 01:12:51.835
<i>Steady. That's it.</i>

01:12:52.002 --> 01:12:53.003
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:12:59.384 --> 01:13:00.385
<i>What?</i>

01:13:03.931 --> 01:13:05.557
<i>-Oh no.
-What happened? Did it work?</i>

01:13:05.724 --> 01:13:07.434
Sorry, buddy!

01:13:07.601 --> 01:13:09.353
<i>-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.</i>

01:13:19.446 --> 01:13:21.448
<i>Hope, are you real?</i>

01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:23.283
<i>I'm real.</i>

01:13:23.909 --> 01:13:24.910
<i>Then let's do this.</i>

01:13:29.915 --> 01:13:31.208
<i>You ready?</i>

01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:32.376
<i>Ready.</i>

01:14:18.422 --> 01:14:19.464
Come on.

01:14:19.631 --> 01:14:20.716
We gotta get that thing out of here.

01:14:20.883 --> 01:14:21.717
No, no, no. Wait.

01:14:21.884 --> 01:14:22.968
He's got Cassie.

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:24.761
-What?
-Scott.

01:14:25.304 --> 01:14:27.389
-Janet.
-Give that to me.

01:14:27.556 --> 01:14:28.432
-We have to go now.
-No.

01:14:28.599 --> 01:14:29.808
He's got Cassie.

01:14:30.184 --> 01:14:32.644
We will save her. I promise you
we will save her...

01:14:34.146 --> 01:14:36.023
but you cannot give that to him.

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.649
I wouldn't trust her.

01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:43.363
Janet has a way of...

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:47.868
changing her mind.

01:14:54.708 --> 01:14:57.211
Hello, Jellybean.

01:15:03.383 --> 01:15:04.468
So...

01:15:08.263 --> 01:15:09.890
what's it gonna be, Scott?

01:15:13.477 --> 01:15:15.729
<i>Well, well.</i>

01:15:16.897 --> 01:15:19.733
<i>If it isn't my old mentor.</i>

01:15:24.279 --> 01:15:25.113
<i>Hi, Hank.</i>

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:29.701
Darren?

01:15:30.369 --> 01:15:32.788
Didn't expect to see
your protégé again after all...

01:15:32.955 --> 01:15:34.665
Holy shit, Darren.

01:15:35.624 --> 01:15:36.959
What happened to you?

01:15:37.125 --> 01:15:39.586
I'm the ultimate weapon!

01:15:50.222 --> 01:15:51.849
Do I need to take it?

01:15:52.307 --> 01:15:53.475
Where is my daughter?

01:15:55.561 --> 01:15:56.562
Scott.

01:15:57.896 --> 01:15:58.897
Don't.

01:15:59.815 --> 01:16:02.025
We had a deal.

01:16:02.651 --> 01:16:04.027
She'll be fine without you.

01:16:29.553 --> 01:16:31.180
<i>So long, Hank.</i>

01:16:38.729 --> 01:16:39.730
Henry.

01:16:46.904 --> 01:16:49.198
You left me right here to die.

01:16:53.368 --> 01:16:54.828
Let's see how they do.

01:17:55.639 --> 01:17:57.099
What did you see?

01:18:05.858 --> 01:18:09.194
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

01:18:11.196 --> 01:18:12.322
But I always wondered.

01:18:16.118 --> 01:18:18.036
When you touched my mind...

01:18:29.506 --> 01:18:31.216
what did you see?

01:18:32.050 --> 01:18:33.302
A monster...

01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:36.221
who thinks he's a god.

01:18:36.638 --> 01:18:39.057
When you can see time the way I do...

01:18:39.224 --> 01:18:41.143
you don't get to close your eyes.

01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:44.021
And you're the only one who sees?

01:18:44.188 --> 01:18:48.901
I am the only one that can see it's broken.

01:18:49.193 --> 01:18:50.360
And who broke it?

01:18:52.863 --> 01:18:54.031
I did.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.243
Every version of me.

01:18:59.411 --> 01:19:00.871
My variants.

01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:02.956
Throughout the Multiverse.

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:08.462
Playing with time, like children.

01:19:10.839 --> 01:19:13.884
But I saw how it ends.

01:19:15.177 --> 01:19:17.179
I saw their chaos...

01:19:17.971 --> 01:19:20.933
spreading across realities.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.353
Universes colliding.

01:19:25.812 --> 01:19:27.064
Endless incursions.

01:19:28.398 --> 01:19:30.359
I saw the Multiverse.

01:19:31.527 --> 01:19:32.945
And it was dying.

01:19:34.655 --> 01:19:35.989
All because of them.

01:19:37.491 --> 01:19:39.326
So, I took control.

01:19:40.035 --> 01:19:41.870
You mean you started a war.

01:19:42.704 --> 01:19:45.958
And now you wanna wipe away
any universe that's a threat to you.

01:19:47.084 --> 01:19:48.710
That's what monsters do.

01:19:48.877 --> 01:19:51.713
That's what conquerors do.

01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:54.967
They burn the broken world.

01:19:55.968 --> 01:19:58.762
And they make a new one.

01:19:58.929 --> 01:20:01.807
You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.

01:20:03.934 --> 01:20:06.270
You only want revenge because they beat you.

01:20:07.187 --> 01:20:08.146
Because you lost.

01:20:08.522 --> 01:20:10.357
I have lost.

01:20:12.025 --> 01:20:16.154
You have no idea what I have lost.

01:20:17.698 --> 01:20:21.577
And I will burn them out of time...

01:20:21.743 --> 01:20:23.161
for what they've done to me.

01:20:24.121 --> 01:20:28.083
You'll be wiping out entire timelines.

01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:31.920
Murdering trillions of people.

01:20:33.338 --> 01:20:35.841
I wish that mattered, Janet.

01:20:57.821 --> 01:20:59.281
<i>Oh, God. What am I doing?</i>

01:21:10.083 --> 01:21:11.251
<i>What?</i>

01:21:15.464 --> 01:21:16.381
<i>Hank!</i>

01:21:20.093 --> 01:21:21.386
Are these your ants?

01:21:22.054 --> 01:21:23.138
From the ant farm?

01:21:23.305 --> 01:21:25.182
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

01:21:25.557 --> 01:21:26.975
How did you find them down here?

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.146
I've been picking up strange signals
ever since we crashed.

01:21:33.315 --> 01:21:35.943
<i>First I thought maybe it was a malfunction.</i>

01:21:36.109 --> 01:21:37.694
Some kind of interference.

01:21:37.861 --> 01:21:39.738
What is that?

01:21:39.905 --> 01:21:41.031
But it wasn't.

01:21:42.407 --> 01:21:43.617
It was the ants.

01:21:45.577 --> 01:21:48.455
They were reaching out the whole time.

01:21:49.915 --> 01:21:53.377
<i>Apparently, they passed through
some sort of time dilation.</i>

01:21:53.961 --> 01:21:56.755
<i>They've lived thousands of years
in a single day...</i>

01:21:57.339 --> 01:22:00.342
<i>expanding their knowledge,
their science...</i>

01:22:00.634 --> 01:22:03.512
<i>becoming more advanced
than I could have ever thought.</i>

01:22:03.846 --> 01:22:05.264
<i>I didn't find them.</i>

01:22:06.139 --> 01:22:07.391
They found me.

01:22:09.476 --> 01:22:11.103
I told you they were smart.

01:22:13.564 --> 01:22:18.569
They've already built something
of a technocratic Class-Two civilization.

01:22:18.861 --> 01:22:21.738
I mean, I know socialism is a charged word...

01:22:21.905 --> 01:22:24.783
-but we could learn a lot from these...
-Dad.

01:22:25.868 --> 01:22:27.160
Yeah, they're my ants.

01:22:27.911 --> 01:22:29.913
And ants don't give up.

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.331
I don't care who this guy is.

01:22:31.498 --> 01:22:32.708
I don't care what he can do.

01:22:32.875 --> 01:22:33.917
I'm getting Cassie.

01:22:34.251 --> 01:22:36.503
So, how do we even the odds against Kang?

01:22:39.631 --> 01:22:41.049
We've got some ideas.

01:22:41.216 --> 01:22:42.217
What are you thinking?

01:22:42.384 --> 01:22:45.387
Well, as a great writer once said...

01:22:46.346 --> 01:22:48.599
"There's always room to grow."

01:22:50.976 --> 01:22:52.060
You read my book?

01:22:52.769 --> 01:22:56.148
Every goddamn word.

01:22:58.775 --> 01:23:00.152
Come on. Let's go to work.

01:23:13.081 --> 01:23:14.917
Hey! I'm sorry.

01:23:15.083 --> 01:23:16.919
That was probably terrifying.

01:23:17.085 --> 01:23:18.378
What are you doing here?

01:23:19.087 --> 01:23:20.255
I'm rescuing you.

01:23:20.631 --> 01:23:21.632
How?

01:23:23.217 --> 01:23:24.843
That's a good question.

01:23:25.469 --> 01:23:28.138
Does this thing have like a key?

01:23:28.305 --> 01:23:30.307
Or a card? Like a room key?

01:23:30.474 --> 01:23:31.683
Do you know, like a...

01:23:33.644 --> 01:23:34.645
Shit!

01:23:42.361 --> 01:23:43.362
<i>Jump and tap.</i>

01:23:52.371 --> 01:23:53.413
Jentorra.

01:23:54.831 --> 01:23:56.625
I'm sorry I got your people hurt.

01:23:58.335 --> 01:23:59.336
How can I help?

01:24:04.508 --> 01:24:05.551
Wow.

01:24:05.717 --> 01:24:06.885
Let's hurt 'em back.

01:24:08.095 --> 01:24:09.304
Damn, you're cool.

01:24:10.222 --> 01:24:11.181
Do you have a plan?

01:24:11.348 --> 01:24:12.599
Freeing you was basically my plan.

01:24:13.725 --> 01:24:14.810
Do you have a plan?

01:24:14.977 --> 01:24:17.020
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

01:24:17.688 --> 01:24:19.356
Then free our people
from the detention cells below...

01:24:19.523 --> 01:24:20.774
and launch a counteroffensive from within.

01:24:20.941 --> 01:24:23.110
Yeah, you have a plan.
So, how do we get a message out?

01:24:23.277 --> 01:24:24.236
Follow me.

01:24:24.403 --> 01:24:25.904
Okay. Great.

01:24:30.284 --> 01:24:33.161
I built an empire down here, Janet.

01:24:35.622 --> 01:24:37.165
And I'm taking it with me.

01:24:53.307 --> 01:24:56.059
You really should've let me out
when you had the chance.

01:25:05.319 --> 01:25:08.447
History is not written.

01:25:10.449 --> 01:25:11.700
<i>It is forged.</i>

01:25:12.492 --> 01:25:14.328
<i>Today, we ascend.</i>

01:25:15.204 --> 01:25:20.209
<i>From this fortress, I will take my revenge
on those who banished me.</i>

01:25:21.668 --> 01:25:25.047
<i>Today we conquer eternity.</i>

01:25:25.839 --> 01:25:28.008
<i>And the dynasty of Kang shall...</i>

01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:33.639
<i>Hello? Is this working?</i>

01:25:34.223 --> 01:25:35.224
Cassie?

01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:37.267
<i>I can't tell if this is working.</i>

01:25:38.644 --> 01:25:40.145
Okay. I think we're on.

01:25:40.312 --> 01:25:41.730
I'll hold them off. Get the message out.

01:25:41.897 --> 01:25:43.565
I thought you were getting the message out.

01:25:45.234 --> 01:25:46.068
Now!

01:25:47.569 --> 01:25:49.738
We're inside.
We breached the tower.

01:25:49.905 --> 01:25:50.906
<i>And I'm with Jentorra.</i>

01:25:51.073 --> 01:25:52.491
<i>He's not invincible.</i>

01:25:58.705 --> 01:26:00.666
I know it might feel like...

01:26:00.832 --> 01:26:02.209
<i>it's too late...</i>

01:26:03.835 --> 01:26:05.921
<i>like all we do is just lose.</i>

01:26:06.463 --> 01:26:08.048
<i>But the family I've lost...</i>

01:26:08.674 --> 01:26:10.300
<i>taught me to keep fighting.</i>

01:26:10.467 --> 01:26:12.344
<i>And if they were here, they would too.</i>

01:26:13.178 --> 01:26:15.180
<i>We need to look out for the little guy.</i>

01:26:15.722 --> 01:26:17.140
My dad taught me that.

01:26:17.599 --> 01:26:19.351
<i>'Cause when people needed help...</i>

01:26:19.935 --> 01:26:21.770
<i>he didn't look the other way.</i>

01:26:22.271 --> 01:26:23.480
<i>And neither do we.</i>

01:26:25.816 --> 01:26:26.775
We need to move!

01:26:26.942 --> 01:26:29.278
Come to the tower! Fight back!

01:26:29.444 --> 01:26:31.822
<i>I know you've been waiting.
Now is the time to strike.</i>

01:26:31.989 --> 01:26:34.157
He knows he can't take all of us.

01:26:34.324 --> 01:26:35.450
<i>Come to the...</i>

01:26:35.617 --> 01:26:36.618
Cassie.

01:26:36.785 --> 01:26:38.745
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

01:26:38.912 --> 01:26:40.539
-Let's go.
-I'll drive.

01:26:46.628 --> 01:26:48.005
Find Lang's daughter.

01:26:51.341 --> 01:26:52.384
Kill her.

01:27:11.486 --> 01:27:12.529
Let's go. Let's go!

01:27:13.113 --> 01:27:14.364
If you want to fight, follow me!

01:27:19.203 --> 01:27:20.412
<i>It's over, Cassie.</i>

01:27:20.829 --> 01:27:22.539
Free the others. Go!

01:27:30.672 --> 01:27:31.757
He's gonna see us coming.

01:27:31.924 --> 01:27:33.967
Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

01:27:34.885 --> 01:27:36.053
Begin the launch.

01:28:28.397 --> 01:28:30.232
<i>Your dad's not here, Cassie...</i>

01:28:30.399 --> 01:28:32.401
but I guess that's not a big surprise.

01:28:55.841 --> 01:28:57.050
<i>Kang!</i>

01:28:58.218 --> 01:29:00.053
<i>We had a deal.</i>

01:29:02.181 --> 01:29:04.474
<i>You took my daughter!</i>

01:29:06.894 --> 01:29:08.270
Holy shit.

01:29:08.937 --> 01:29:10.105
That's big.

01:29:18.864 --> 01:29:20.490
<i>You lied to me!</i>

01:29:21.783 --> 01:29:23.911
<i>Our word is our bond.</i>

01:29:24.703 --> 01:29:27.873
<i>Without that, we're nothing!</i>

01:29:28.665 --> 01:29:29.666
Bring him down.

01:29:29.833 --> 01:29:30.709
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:29:37.466 --> 01:29:38.842
<i>Keep going. I've got them.</i>

01:29:40.761 --> 01:29:42.095
<i>Yeah, come on!</i>

01:29:56.610 --> 01:29:57.819
<i>There's so many!</i>

01:29:57.986 --> 01:30:00.239
<i>Scott! I can't hold them!</i>

01:30:11.333 --> 01:30:12.376
<i>They came.</i>

01:30:14.127 --> 01:30:16.129
<i>Way to go, Cassie!</i>

01:30:18.549 --> 01:30:19.633
Yes!

01:30:19.967 --> 01:30:22.386
<i>Come on! Let's go!</i>

01:30:27.391 --> 01:30:29.268
Revolution!

01:30:42.447 --> 01:30:44.491
Burn it all down.

01:30:44.658 --> 01:30:45.868
Fight!

01:31:03.093 --> 01:31:04.970
Cover! Get down!

01:31:13.645 --> 01:31:15.147
What is the bridge code?

01:31:15.689 --> 01:31:16.815
<i>I'll die first.</i>

01:31:17.441 --> 01:31:18.650
One-eight-one-four-seven.

01:31:19.109 --> 01:31:19.985
<i>Damn!</i>

01:31:35.417 --> 01:31:36.585
You'll need this.

01:31:39.046 --> 01:31:39.796
Hi.

01:31:40.714 --> 01:31:41.673
This is our home!

01:31:42.674 --> 01:31:44.051
Let's take it back!

01:31:48.555 --> 01:31:49.556
No!

01:31:56.855 --> 01:31:58.815
I have holes.

01:32:00.609 --> 01:32:03.237
I have holes!

01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:11.245
I didn't know he could do that.

01:32:20.963 --> 01:32:21.964
<i>Kang!</i>

01:32:22.548 --> 01:32:23.841
<i>Where is she?</i>

01:32:24.508 --> 01:32:25.759
Launch now!

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.522
<i>What is that?</i>

01:32:38.897 --> 01:32:40.357
<i>He's getting out.</i>

01:32:40.732 --> 01:32:41.942
<i>Oh, no, he's not.</i>

01:32:49.616 --> 01:32:51.159
Keep him away from the rings.

01:33:30.407 --> 01:33:31.491
Dad!

01:33:34.286 --> 01:33:35.621
Dad, I'm coming!

01:33:47.174 --> 01:33:48.175
Dad!

01:33:56.517 --> 01:33:58.018
Nowhere left to run.

01:34:06.985 --> 01:34:08.111
Please let this work.

01:34:26.547 --> 01:34:28.048
Hey, where do you think you're going?

01:34:28.215 --> 01:34:29.174
Let's go.

01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:31.301
You think this is over? Come on! Let's go.

01:34:31.468 --> 01:34:33.053
Darren, just stop...

01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:35.848
trying to be whatever this is.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.141
I don't know what to be.

01:34:40.227 --> 01:34:41.728
Tell me what to be.

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:44.189
I don't know.
Just don't be a dick.

01:34:44.898 --> 01:34:46.358
It's too late.

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:48.110
Look at me.

01:34:49.695 --> 01:34:51.238
I'm such a dick.

01:34:51.655 --> 01:34:54.074
It's never too late to stop being a dick.

01:34:59.788 --> 01:35:00.956
<i>We've gotta stop him.</i>

01:35:02.791 --> 01:35:04.167
<i>I have an idea.</i>

01:35:06.879 --> 01:35:07.713
<i>Ready?</i>

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.047
<i>Probably not.</i>

01:35:11.842 --> 01:35:14.303
<i>One, two, three. Now!</i>

01:35:37.326 --> 01:35:38.660
Dad!

01:35:38.952 --> 01:35:39.912
Dad!

01:35:40.746 --> 01:35:41.747
Cassie?

01:35:43.749 --> 01:35:44.625
You're huge.

01:35:44.791 --> 01:35:46.418
I'm huge.

01:35:50.839 --> 01:35:52.424
I love you, Peanut.

01:35:52.591 --> 01:35:53.926
I love you too.

01:35:54.301 --> 01:35:55.886
I'm so proud of you.

01:35:56.637 --> 01:35:58.680
I feel like I'm hugging Godzilla.

01:35:58.847 --> 01:36:01.433
I know. It feels so cool.

01:36:01.725 --> 01:36:03.393
I know, right?

01:36:04.144 --> 01:36:05.270
I'm so hungry.

01:36:05.437 --> 01:36:06.438
Yeah, that happens.

01:36:06.605 --> 01:36:08.774
-I could eat everything.
-Everything. I know.

01:36:09.316 --> 01:36:11.652
-But I really want like a lime.
-Right?

01:36:11.818 --> 01:36:13.862
-Citrus. It's weird. I know.
-Citrus.

01:36:14.029 --> 01:36:15.030
It's...

01:36:25.874 --> 01:36:27.334
Take the tower!

01:36:58.949 --> 01:37:00.200
It's over.

01:37:02.119 --> 01:37:04.121
You still can't see it.

01:37:06.123 --> 01:37:09.001
It's never over.

01:38:25.744 --> 01:38:27.496
-We have to go, right now.
-No.

01:38:27.663 --> 01:38:28.664
-Come on.
-No!

01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:29.915
I know, I know, but we have to go.

01:38:30.082 --> 01:38:31.458
-No!
-Come on.

01:39:21.717 --> 01:39:22.926
<i>You son of a...</i>

01:39:26.013 --> 01:39:27.514
-Oh, God.
-Scott.

01:39:27.806 --> 01:39:28.807
Come on.

01:39:33.562 --> 01:39:36.190
You think this is new to me?

01:39:37.524 --> 01:39:42.237
Do you know how many rebellions
I have put down?

01:39:43.947 --> 01:39:45.407
No, no, no.

01:39:45.574 --> 01:39:49.077
How many worlds I've conquered?

01:39:49.953 --> 01:39:52.164
How many Avengers I've killed?

01:39:52.331 --> 01:39:54.875
And you think you can beat me?

01:39:55.042 --> 01:39:56.668
I am Kang!

01:39:56.835 --> 01:39:57.753
You...

01:39:58.795 --> 01:40:01.048
You talk to ants.

01:41:20.919 --> 01:41:23.463
My name is Darren...

01:41:23.630 --> 01:41:28.135
and I am not a dick!

01:41:49.656 --> 01:41:50.908
Sorry I'm late.

01:41:53.202 --> 01:41:54.453
Lotta ants.

01:41:55.871 --> 01:41:56.872
Oh, is this you?

01:41:58.999 --> 01:42:00.459
You were right about me, Cassie.

01:42:01.752 --> 01:42:02.753
Darren.

01:42:04.546 --> 01:42:05.547
Are you okay?

01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:09.551
Probably not.

01:42:10.886 --> 01:42:12.554
-Darren?
-Hi, Hope.

01:42:13.514 --> 01:42:15.015
You changed your hair.

01:42:17.726 --> 01:42:19.603
What the hell happened?

01:42:20.354 --> 01:42:21.188
Yeah. No...

01:42:21.730 --> 01:42:23.190
It's a whole thing. I'll tell you later.

01:42:23.982 --> 01:42:24.983
That was...

01:42:25.526 --> 01:42:26.944
I don't know what to say.

01:42:27.528 --> 01:42:28.820
Thanks, Scott.

01:42:29.446 --> 01:42:32.658
You always were a brother to me.

01:42:34.785 --> 01:42:35.786
I was?

01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:44.753
I was.

01:42:58.892 --> 01:43:00.561
And at least I died...

01:43:02.104 --> 01:43:03.647
an Avenger.

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:07.943
Yeah.

01:43:08.986 --> 01:43:09.862
-You did.
-Yeah.

01:43:10.737 --> 01:43:11.738
You're in.

01:43:28.338 --> 01:43:29.965
A lot has happened today.

01:43:30.757 --> 01:43:31.884
<i>-Henry?
-</i>Janet?

01:43:32.050 --> 01:43:33.886
-Mom, where are you?
<i>-I'm in the tower.</i>

01:43:34.052 --> 01:43:36.054
I think I can give us one shot back.

01:43:36.221 --> 01:43:38.015
But we don't have much time.

01:43:38.223 --> 01:43:39.850
If we wanna go home...

01:43:42.311 --> 01:43:43.729
we have to go now.

01:43:44.354 --> 01:43:45.355
We'll finish this.

01:43:47.649 --> 01:43:48.692
Thank you.

01:43:49.776 --> 01:43:50.652
Thank you.

01:43:52.738 --> 01:43:54.281
Come on! Let's go!

01:43:54.448 --> 01:43:55.657
All right. Good luck.

01:43:56.033 --> 01:43:57.075
Good luck.
Come on.

01:44:27.773 --> 01:44:28.774
Thanks, buddy.

01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:32.110
You did it.

01:44:35.906 --> 01:44:37.032
Let's go home.

01:44:58.887 --> 01:44:59.888
Where's Scott?

01:45:00.055 --> 01:45:01.598
He was right behind me.

01:45:44.683 --> 01:45:46.268
You should've looked the other way.

01:45:46.435 --> 01:45:49.104
Yeah, well, never been great at that.

01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:58.530
And you're not getting out.

01:46:09.124 --> 01:46:10.542
I want you to remember.

01:46:12.044 --> 01:46:13.587
You could've gone home.

01:46:28.727 --> 01:46:30.771
You could've seen your daughter again.

01:46:44.535 --> 01:46:45.953
But you thought you could win.

01:46:59.341 --> 01:47:00.843
I don't have to win.

01:47:02.344 --> 01:47:04.263
We both just have to lose.

01:47:55.355 --> 01:47:56.732
Dad!

01:48:03.864 --> 01:48:04.865
Where... Where...

01:48:05.157 --> 01:48:06.241
Where is she? Is she...

01:48:06.408 --> 01:48:07.910
-No, she's okay.
-Where is she?

01:48:08.076 --> 01:48:09.453
She's okay. She's okay.

01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:11.330
-Scott, they're all okay. They're all okay.
-She's safe?

01:48:11.496 --> 01:48:12.497
You did it.

01:48:12.664 --> 01:48:13.665
You did it.

01:48:17.085 --> 01:48:19.004
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
-No, no, no.

01:48:19.171 --> 01:48:20.589
No, don't let go. Don't let go.

01:48:21.215 --> 01:48:22.382
Don't let go.

01:48:22.549 --> 01:48:23.800
Don't ever let go.

01:48:25.427 --> 01:48:26.762
I got you.

01:48:29.556 --> 01:48:30.724
You came back.

01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:42.402
I love you, Hope.

01:48:45.072 --> 01:48:46.406
I love you, Scott.

01:50:00.272 --> 01:50:01.607
Let's go home.

01:50:04.276 --> 01:50:05.485
Home's good.

01:50:13.911 --> 01:50:15.579
<i>My life doesn't make sense.</i>

01:50:15.746 --> 01:50:18.081
<i>I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.</i>

01:50:18.248 --> 01:50:20.959
<i>"Scott you just saved the Quantum Realm
with your family...</i>

01:50:21.126 --> 01:50:23.003
<i>"and drank a guy without holes.</i>

01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:25.422
<i>"Why does this kind of stuff keep
happening to you?</i>

01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:27.090
<i>"That doesn't make any sense."</i>

01:50:27.257 --> 01:50:28.592
<i>But you know what?</i>

01:50:28.759 --> 01:50:30.761
<i>Who said life has to make sense?</i>

01:50:35.098 --> 01:50:36.099
Rubin!

01:50:36.266 --> 01:50:37.476
You are the bug!

01:50:38.727 --> 01:50:41.230
I was wrong. Yeah.
You are the other bug.

01:50:41.396 --> 01:50:42.689
You're the bug man.

01:50:42.856 --> 01:50:45.442
You get big and get small
like a big bug!

01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:48.737
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

01:50:48.904 --> 01:50:49.905
Twelve dollar.

01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:52.783
Twelve!

01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:55.494
<i>I used to wonder if this
chapter in my life was over...</i>

01:50:55.661 --> 01:50:58.830
<i>but as Cassie reminded me,
"There's always someone you can help."</i>

01:50:59.623 --> 01:51:02.000
Came out of cake making
retirement for you.

01:51:04.461 --> 01:51:05.462
Wow.

01:51:06.171 --> 01:51:07.464
You made this yourself?

01:51:07.631 --> 01:51:10.050
-Yeah! I don't usually make the cakes.
-I know.

01:51:10.217 --> 01:51:12.010
This is the first one I've made since 1997.

01:51:12.177 --> 01:51:13.387
You're a real artist.

01:51:13.554 --> 01:51:15.514
<i>It's been a pretty wild ride.</i>

01:51:15.681 --> 01:51:18.100
<i>One day you're fired from Baskin-Robbins...</i>

01:51:18.267 --> 01:51:21.061
<i>the next you're beating a time-traveling
space king.</i>

01:51:22.145 --> 01:51:24.106
<i>We did beat him, right?</i>

01:51:25.566 --> 01:51:26.775
<i>I mean, yeah, that's what happened.</i>

01:51:26.942 --> 01:51:29.111
<i>He was getting out and he didn't get out.</i>

01:51:30.571 --> 01:51:31.655
<i>I think.</i>

01:51:33.156 --> 01:51:35.742
<i>But he also said something bad was coming...</i>

01:51:36.159 --> 01:51:39.246
<i>and that everyone would die
if he didn't get out.</i>

01:51:39.413 --> 01:51:42.040
<i>Wait. So, did I just kill everyone?</i>

01:51:42.749 --> 01:51:44.793
<i>Is everyone gonna die because of me?</i>

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:46.086
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:51:47.212 --> 01:51:48.672
<i>Oh my... What did I do?</i>

01:51:50.883 --> 01:51:52.259
<i>What did I do?</i>

01:51:55.762 --> 01:51:57.848
<i>You know what? It's probably fine.</i>

01:51:58.390 --> 01:52:00.475
<i>Like I said, life doesn't make any sense...</i>

01:52:00.642 --> 01:52:03.770
<i>so maybe stop asking so
many questions, Scott.</i>

01:52:03.937 --> 01:52:05.397
<i>Stop overthinking it.</i>

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:09.693
Surprise!

01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:13.989
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

01:52:15.199 --> 01:52:16.533
It's not my birthday.

01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:19.203
I know. But I missed a few.

01:52:21.622 --> 01:52:23.498
<i>This is good. We're all together.</i>

01:52:23.874 --> 01:52:25.292
<i>You're fine.</i>

01:52:25.459 --> 01:52:28.378
<i>Everything's probably fine.</i>

01:52:28.545 --> 01:52:30.881
<i>Kang's gone. You did it.</i>

01:52:32.007 --> 01:52:33.759
<i>Don't have to worry about that guy anymore.</i>

01:52:33.926 --> 01:52:34.927
Thanks.

01:52:38.430 --> 01:52:40.432
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

01:55:18.298 --> 01:55:21.885
So, the exiled one is dead.

01:55:24.179 --> 01:55:26.098
You sure he's dead?

01:55:26.723 --> 01:55:29.601
If it wasn't true, I wouldn't call you.

01:55:30.227 --> 01:55:33.355
Must really eat you up,
that you're not the one who killed him.

01:55:33.689 --> 01:55:36.358
None of us...

01:55:37.192 --> 01:55:38.902
killed him.

01:55:41.196 --> 01:55:42.573
They did.

01:55:43.448 --> 01:55:47.995
They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.

01:55:48.662 --> 01:55:50.122
And if we let them...

01:55:50.581 --> 01:55:52.416
they will take...

01:55:53.834 --> 01:55:55.460
everything...

01:55:56.378 --> 01:55:58.380
we've built.

01:55:59.423 --> 01:56:01.967
So let's stop wasting time.

01:56:05.596 --> 01:56:06.805
We're late.

01:56:08.807 --> 01:56:11.143
How many did you call?

01:56:11.476 --> 01:56:13.896
All of us.

02:03:36.797 --> 02:03:41.802
Time is everything.

02:03:47.057 --> 02:03:50.060
It shapes our lives.

02:03:51.353 --> 02:03:55.315
But, perhaps, we can shape...

02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:58.193
it.

02:03:59.444 --> 02:04:00.571
It's him.

02:04:00.988 --> 02:04:04.283
What? You made him sound
like this terrifying figure.

02:04:05.951 --> 02:04:07.035
He is.
