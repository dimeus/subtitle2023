1
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:15,858
The Second World War
is coming to an end.

2
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,688
Finland and the Soviet Union

3
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:22,517
have signed
the Moscow Armistice

4
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,260
which decrees that Finland
must disarm the Nazis

5
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:28,610
and drive them out of Lapland.

6
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:35,486
The Nazis adopt
a scorched earth tactic

7
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,011
and destroy
all roads, bridges,

8
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:42,276
villages and towns
in their path.

9
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,239
Deep in the wilderness
of Lapland,

10
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:54,375
there is a man who has decided
to leave the war behind him.

11
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:56,986
For good.

12
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:00,397
Yeah!

13
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,248
He's riding
to his death anyway.

14
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,268
Get off the horse!

15
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,363
Where do you think
you're going, old man?

16
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:49,410
There's nothing down there.
We made sure of that.

17
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,154
What do you got there?

18
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,866
This old fucker
is a gold miner.

19
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:20,745
You got gold in those bags?

20
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,319
-Take a look at this!

21
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,281
-We're rich, boys!

22
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,504
-You're dead!

23
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:55,476
-Get down on your knees.

24
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,173
These bags
are full of gold!

25
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:04,224
Get down on your knees,
grandpa!

26
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:07,836
Huh?

27
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:13,624
-Shoot the fucker!

28
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,713
-Fuck him up!

29
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:23,765
Thanks for the gold!

30
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:28,074
We've got gold!

31
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:30,293
Thank you, old fuck...

32
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,409
Wait.

33
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,949
-Now.

34
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:46,485
Fire!

35
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:01,761
Cease fire!

36
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:33,853
Huh?

37
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:53,089
You...

38
00:26:57,964 --> 00:26:59,095
and you.

39
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:02,229
On the sides of the road, now!

40
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,567
How many mines
did we bury here?

41
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:39,092
All of them.

42
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,664
Pick two of our female friends
and bring them to me.

43
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:48,579
And some rope.

44
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:03,856
You...

45
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:06,510
and you.

46
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:14,954
Pick me.

47
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,588
Thank you, General.

48
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,373
I will pass on
the information.

49
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:28,244
Over and out.

50
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:35,251
The General,
he has given us orders.

51
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:40,604
Turn back and head to Norway
from Finland immediately.

52
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:43,129
Did you tell him he just
killed seven of our men?

53
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:44,173
I did.

54
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:46,088
And?

55
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:49,091
He thinks we were lucky.

56
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,442
Fucking lucky.

57
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:59,580
The dog tags belong
to a man named Aatami Korpi.

58
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:05,629
He was a Finnish commando.
The most feared in his unit.

59
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:11,113
The General said, and I quote,

60
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,550
"He's one mean motherfucker

61
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:15,552
"that you do not
want to mess with."

62
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:22,037
He fought in the Winter War.

63
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:25,214
Lost his home and his family
to the Russians.

64
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,393
He became a ruthless,
vengeful soldier

65
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,004
who took orders from no one.

66
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:38,097
The Finns, they gave up trying
to discipline or control him.

67
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,620
They just sent him out,

68
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:43,189
alone into the wilderness
to hunt Russian patrols.

69
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,975
He became a one-man
death squad.

70
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:55,723
The reports
are unconfirmed,

71
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:59,988
but it looks like
he has over 300 Russian kills.

72
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:04,863
The Russians,
they gave him a name.

73
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:08,736
They call him Koschei,

74
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:11,652
"The Immortal."

75
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:14,873
Immortal?

76
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,337
The road is clear, sir.

77
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,516
We are going to follow
our orders, right?

78
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:53,650
We are turning back?

79
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:57,263
No.

80
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:00,657
We are not turning back.

81
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:06,054
We are losing the war. We are.

82
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:10,667
In a few months,
this all will be over for us.

83
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,629
When we get back,
they will...

84
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:17,892
hang us all.

85
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,682
That gold is our way out.

86
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:45,996
-Eyes open!

87
00:34:48,738 --> 00:34:50,044
Check the sides.

88
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:55,789
Nothing here.

89
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,339
Oh, wait,
I see movement.

90
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:26,341
Don't fall behind!

91
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,414
Hey, hey... Hey!

92
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:41,938
Gasoline!

93
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:51,818
The dogs lost the scent!

94
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,435
What's happening?

95
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:03,482
There's gasoline on the road.

96
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,180
They are useless!

97
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,487
-Calm down, boy!

98
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:17,452
Hey!

99
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,156
Release the dog.

100
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:28,681
Release the dog!

101
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:30,900
Go on, boy!

102
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,781
-Finish him.

103
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,292
Immortal or not,
a man needs air.

104
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:59,380
Now, get me the gold.

105
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:48,473
Go after him! Now!

106
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,376
One more meter
and I'll have you shot!

107
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:16,865
Desertion is punishable
by death.

108
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:40,715
Fuck this.

109
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:45,171
Hey!

110
00:42:45,998 --> 00:42:47,739
Come here.

111
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,831
Find me a boat.

112
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:02,880
Any last words?

113
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:10,104
I didn't think so.

114
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:31,490
For your troubles.

115
00:49:53,947 --> 00:49:55,079
Put the hat back on.

116
00:53:22,938 --> 00:53:24,984
This son of a bitch
is still alive.

117
00:53:28,857 --> 00:53:29,989
Shoot the man

118
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:32,078
and shoot the dog, too.

119
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:51,140
And the dog!

120
00:53:55,754 --> 00:53:57,234
Shoot the fucking dog!

121
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:08,549
Muller?

122
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:33,487
Muller?

123
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:22,934
The plane is ready.

124
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:26,111
What about the rest
of our squad?

125
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:28,461
They don't need us
to get to Norway.

126
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,245
The boys have
a crateful of booze

127
00:58:30,289 --> 00:58:32,509
and a truckful of bitches.

128
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,685
I'm sure they'll
figure something out.

129
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:36,730
I would.

130
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:50,831
The road is blocked.
Come and take a look at this.

131
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:55,488
What's going on?

132
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,185
There's something in the road.

133
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:36,311
Is this the plane?

134
00:59:39,445 --> 00:59:40,881
No, idiot.

135
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:44,755
This is something else.

136
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,263
The pilot has been hanged.

137
01:00:24,272 --> 01:00:27,362
-That's my rope.
-What?

138
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:29,669
That's the rope I used
to hang Korpi with.

139
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:42,073
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

140
01:00:44,292 --> 01:00:46,077
I recognize it, I swear.

141
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:48,470
What's the order?

142
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:51,648
Everybody move!

143
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:53,954
Start the engines.
Come on, let's go.

144
01:01:03,355 --> 01:01:04,661
Let's go, go!

145
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:10,536
Well?

146
01:01:14,322 --> 01:01:15,323
He's back.

147
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:20,328
He's hanging from
a rope somewhere.

148
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:21,460
He's dead.

149
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,728
-What's so fucking funny?
-Nothing.

150
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,687
What the fuck
are you smiling for, then?

151
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:42,394
Do you assholes really think
you have succeeded

152
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:45,049
where hundreds of Russians
have died trying?

153
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:51,055
We all know the story.

154
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:57,931
You'll see what happens when
you take everything from him.

155
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:02,893
He won't give up.

156
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:06,418
He'll just keep coming back.

157
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:09,769
Do you really believe
that he's immortal?

158
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:12,076
No.

159
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:15,775
He just refuses to die.

160
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:22,477
We have a word for that
in Finland,

161
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:24,044
but it's impossible
to translate.

162
01:02:25,306 --> 01:02:26,307
You see,

163
01:02:27,526 --> 01:02:29,658
this is not about
who's the strongest.

164
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:32,879
This is about not giving up.

165
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:35,708
And he won't.

166
01:02:38,015 --> 01:02:39,059
Ever.

167
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:46,850
No matter what
you bitches are trying.

168
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:49,983
You will make him stronger.

169
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:53,073
So...

170
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:56,337
what is so fucking funny,

171
01:02:57,817 --> 01:02:59,166
is that you...

172
01:03:01,995 --> 01:03:03,344
your boyfriend...

173
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:08,741
and everything that is left
of your sorry-assed company...

174
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,092
are already dead.

175
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:20,100
-What?

176
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:38,423
Was that one of ours?

177
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:12,473
Was that Jens?

178
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,287
We almost ran
into the bitches.

179
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,419
Can somebody tell me
what the fuck is going on?

180
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:52,992
Nothing. It's all good, sir.

181
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:45,392
Sir.

182
01:06:45,436 --> 01:06:46,393
They're all dead.

183
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:51,181
We are almost there.
Step on it!

184
01:07:13,594 --> 01:07:14,595
Wolf.

185
01:07:15,988 --> 01:07:17,685
Go out there and kill him.

186
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:27,347
One,

187
01:07:27,956 --> 01:07:29,001
two,

188
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:30,916
three!

189
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:23,751
Keep going!

190
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:28,104
Keep going.

191
01:08:49,342 --> 01:08:51,170
Please... Please...

192
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:11,321
That's him, that's Koschei.

193
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:30,911
Do you see him?

194
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:36,308
Yep.
He's still down there.

195
01:13:07,295 --> 01:13:09,950
It's bad. It's bad, I need...

196
01:13:09,994 --> 01:13:12,213
If you're not dead,
you fly this fucking plane!

197
01:13:26,489 --> 01:13:27,751
Did you hear that?

198
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:29,796
It's nothing.
Just an old plane.

199
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,762
We might have a problem.

200
01:17:04,663 --> 01:17:06,752
Die. Fucker!

201
01:17:06,796 --> 01:17:07,840
Why

202
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:09,015
won't you

203
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,061
die?

204
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,034
Fuck you!

205
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,482
To your positions.

206
01:21:11,736 --> 01:21:12,650
Hello.

207
01:21:15,653 --> 01:21:17,742
Where did you get that tank?

208
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:20,049
From the Nazis.

209
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:22,878
Where are the Nazis?

210
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:27,708
- Except this asshole,
they're all in hell.

211
01:21:28,492 --> 01:21:29,797
Hell?

212
01:21:33,976 --> 01:21:35,716
Were there others?

213
01:21:37,457 --> 01:21:39,198
Everyone else is dead.

214
01:24:57,396 --> 01:24:58,702
Bills.

215
01:24:58,832 --> 01:25:01,313
Big ones, please.

216
01:25:05,622 --> 01:25:08,538
Won't be so damn heavy to carry.
