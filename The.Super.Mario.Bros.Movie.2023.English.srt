it was incredible.

Mario, seriously,

146
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,464

147
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,235

149
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,172
Yeah, but what's with
the outfits?

150
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:10,668
Plumbers wearing white gloves?

151
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,505
That's right,
you got to have a trademark.

152
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:13,671

153
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:14,914
Don't listen to them.

154
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,949
The world laughed
at da Vinci, too.

155
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,819
Mm, I'm not sure they did, Ma.

156
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:21,514
Dad, what did you think?

157
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:23,351
I think you're nuts.

158
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:27,828
You don't leave a steady job
for some crazy dream.

159
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:29,192
And the worst part?

160
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:32,030
You're bringing your brother
down with you.

161
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,867
Well, thanks, Dad.

162
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,331
Thanks for your support.

163
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:40,434

165

Hey.

166
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,157
Uh, you're not bringing me down.

167
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:03,094
You know what?
What do they know, huh?

168
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:04,623
It's not just them.

169
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:06,196
Our whole lives,
everyone's telling us

170
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:08,363
we can't do this,
we can't do that.

171
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:11,234
I'm just sick and tired
of feeling so small.

00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,733
stopping subway service
and flooding Downtown Brooklyn.

I promise you.

to fixing this.

177
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:23,147
Go back!

Somebody, save Brooklyn!

179
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:27,052

00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:33,850
Destiny Del Vecchio
from high school?

183
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,159
What? No.

184
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,161
- Just come on.

185
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:41,528
It's more than
the storm drains can handle!

186
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:45,235
Come on! We got to pump it!

187
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:50,636
I got this.

188
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:54,376
They're not even looking
in the right place.

189
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,114
Come on, Lu.

190
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:06,718
You are not seriously considering...

191
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:07,994
Mario!

192
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,940
We got to get
to that pressure valve.

193
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,274
Mamma mia.

194
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,863
Uh...

195
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:06,580
I knew saving Brooklyn
was a bad idea.

196
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,186
Come on.

197
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,293
Whoa.

198
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:21,067
What is this place?

199
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,990
Looks like nobody's
been down here for years.

200
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:57,466
Luigi?

201
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:01,602
Luigi, are you in there?

202
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:09,610
Luigi!

203
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:13,779
What?

204
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,273
Whoa.

205
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:45,085
Luigi!

206
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,483
Mario!

207
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,487
Give me your hand!

208
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,159
It's all gonna be okay!

209
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,523
How is this gonna be okay?

210
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:56,558
I'm telling you,
nothing can hurt us

211
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,263
as long as we're together.

212
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:03,235
Mario!

213
00:17:04,062 --> 00:17:06,865
Luigi!

214
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,540
Do not touch that mushroom!
You'll die!

215
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:49,105
Oh, I'm sorry.
That one's perfectly fine.

216
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:50,645
That's a little mushroom man.

217
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,482
A little mushroom man
talking to me.

218
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:53,945
Pleased to meet you.

219
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,848
I'm Toad.

220
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:58,257
Uh, Mario.

221
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:03,262
So this is, uh... this is...
this is not a dream?

222
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:04,989
- That hurt, right?

223
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:07,299
- Yes!
- Definitely not a dream.

224
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,862
Then it's... this place is...

225
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:12,832
The Mushroom Kingdom!

226
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:14,438
Mushrooms? Really?

227
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:17,309
Now, that is
a cruel twist of fate.

228
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:23,975
Hello.

229
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,483
Yeah, I'm actually looking
for somebody.

230
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:27,979
Uh, my brother, in fact.

231
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:31,015
He looks exactly like me
but tall and skinny and green.

232
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:33,655
See, last time I saw him, he...
he was falling through a pipe.

233
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,086
It was foggy, and...
and I believe there was lava.

234
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:39,463
Uh, that is not good.

235
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,597
Um, your brother

236
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:44,127
has landed in the Dark Lands.

237
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:45,304
They're under...

238
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:47,240
Bowser's control.

239
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,670
Bowser?

240
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,641
He's the most evil,
wretched creature alive.

241
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:57,415
I'm taking you
to see the princess.

242
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,549
She can help you.

243
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:01,144
She can do anything.

244
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:03,146
Princess?

245
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,328
Come on, Mario!

246
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:11,429
Our big adventure begins now!

247
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:13,057
Hang on, Luigi.

248
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:43,494
Mario? Mario?

249
00:19:43,494 --> 00:19:45,331
Where are you?

250
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:46,464
Huh?

251
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,438
Oh.

252
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:29,166
Yes!

253
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,707
You just got a-Luigi'd.

254
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:49,884
This way, Mario.

255
00:21:49,884 --> 00:21:52,887
The princess lives
right on that hill.

256
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:02,864
Excuse me, everybody.
Coming through.

257
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,800
Got a big adventure
happening right now.

258
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,065
Just clear a path for us.

259
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:07,671
- If I could just...
- Here you go.

260
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:08,969
Excuse me.

261
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:11,136
Excuse me, everybody!
Coming through!

262
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:14,678
This guy's brother is
going to die imminently!

263
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:16,240
Out of the way, please!

264
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,780
Just trying to clear a path.
That's all I'm doing.

265
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,144
He's gonna be fine.

266
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:20,376
- Chanterelle.
- Morning.

267
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:22,081
- Nice to see you, bud.

268
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:25,491
Does this thing work?

269
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:26,723
Yes, works great.

270
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:28,890
You just have to blow into it.

271
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,497
And up we go.

272
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,323
Wait, up?

273
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:55,785
Whoa. Okay, so these bricks
are just floating here? Uh...

274
00:22:55,785 --> 00:22:57,787
Just pop in this pipe,
and we're on our way.

275
00:22:57,787 --> 00:22:58,986
Oh.

276
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,691
- It's the only way to fly, man.

277
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:05,388
Oh, wow.
Love these pi...

278
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:12,802
Whoo!

279
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:20,073
Huh?

280
00:23:26,345 --> 00:23:28,246
Oh, come on.

281
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:34,252
Here we are. Palace doors.

282
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:36,089
Bing, bang, boom.

283
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:39,631
Come on!

284
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,061
Whoo!

285
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:43,063
Whoa.

286
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:51,577
Pretty impressive, am I right?

287
00:23:54,472 --> 00:23:56,582
Hold it right there, you two.

288
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:59,343
Oh, hey.
I need to see the princess.

289
00:23:59,343 --> 00:24:00,916
It's an emergency.

290
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:04,018
What princess?

291
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:06,053
I never heard of any princess.

292
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:07,219
Oh, wait, I did.

293
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:09,452
Our princess, though,
is in another castle.

294
00:24:09,452 --> 00:24:10,794
Oh, yeah. That's right.

295
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:12,796
You should try
another castle, maybe.

296
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:14,963
She ain't in this one.

297
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:15,997
Huh?

298
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,537
Okay, so they're
messing with you,

299
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:19,539
and I don't like it.

300
00:24:23,204 --> 00:24:25,270
What do you guys, um...
What do you want to eat?

301
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,239
Anything...
anything your hearts desire.

302
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,075
Go.

303
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:30,715
I am ready to scramble it up.

304
00:24:38,217 --> 00:24:40,351
Hey! Intruder!

305
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:41,660
- Stop him!

306
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,255
- Intruder!

307
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:45,092
- Stop him!
- Stop him!

308
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:47,292
Now! Stop him!

309
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:03,715
Council, your attention.

310
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,750
Bowser has found the Super Star

311
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,280
and is headed
toward our kingdom.

312
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,591
Its power will make him invincible.

313
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:13,593
We will be destroyed.

314
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:17,960
Princess, what are we gonna do?

315
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,062
I will not let him hurt you.

316
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:29,169
We are going to stop Bowser.

317
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:30,676
How? Look at us.

318
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:32,238
We're adorable.

319
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm going to convince
the great Kong army to help us.

320
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,146
Together, we'll annihilate
that monster.

321
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,819
Their mad king
doesn't make alliances.

322
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:44,349
The Kongs will never agree.

323
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:46,054
I can convince him.

324
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:48,925
I'll leave for the
Jungle Kingdom in the morning.

325
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,666
Good luck, Princess,
for all our sakes.

326
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:06,437
Princess!

327
00:26:10,718 --> 00:26:12,377
Princess. Hi...

328
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:17,316
Wait. Release him.

329
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:21,584
Whoa.

330
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:23,729
Are you...

331
00:26:25,324 --> 00:26:26,622
He's a human!

332
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:28,096
I mean, you are a human, right?

333
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:29,966
It's just,
you're so small and...

334
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:31,330
- Hey.
- Wait, wait, wait.

335
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,233
Let-let's go back.
Where did you come from?

336
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,708
Uh, me and my little brother Luigi,

337
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,270
we-we fell down this pipe.

338
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,240
And now he's lost s-somewhere
in the Dark Lands.

339
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,815
Then it's only a matter of time
until he's captured by Bowser.

340
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,751
But you're in luck.

341
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:47,511
I'm on my way to stop him.

342
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:48,787
Well, take me with you.

343
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:51,856
This guy's a lunatic, a psycho.

344
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:54,760
He will eat you for breakfast.

345
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,223
He won't even notice it, probably,

346
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:59,061
'cause you're very, very small.

347
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:00,964
You know what?
Make fun of me all you want,

348
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:03,131
but you are gonna help me
find my brother.

349
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,002
Please?

350
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:08,367
Well, okay.

351
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:10,468
Let's see what you're made of.

352
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:13,108
Is that a yes?

353
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:16,177
No, that's a "let's see
what you're made of."

354
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,899
If you can finish this,
you're coming with me.

355
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:09,428
Watch and learn.

356
00:28:34,717 --> 00:28:36,290
Hi-yah!

357
00:28:52,638 --> 00:28:54,308
That was amazing.

358
00:28:54,308 --> 00:28:56,915
Wait. How-how am I
supposed to do that?

359
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:58,345
With the Power-Ups.

360
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:01,084
They give us special abilities.

361
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,055
Ugh. Really?

362
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:06,925
Go on. Eat it.

363
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:13,162
Now, this has to be a mushroom?

364
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:15,659
'Cause I just hate
mushrooms and...

365
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,100
Okay, okay.

366
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:20,664
Are you sure
there's not, like, a...

367
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:21,874
- Down the hatch.
-  Ow.

368
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:23,634
Yep, there it is, and all gone.

369
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:27,374
Oh, not cool.

370
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:28,804
Uh...

371
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,379
Huh?

372
00:29:41,588 --> 00:29:42,961
Whoa-oh-oh!

373
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:45,260
- I'm tall.
- And strong.

374
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:49,297
And you can jump.

375
00:29:49,297 --> 00:29:51,332
Oh, I got this.

376
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,070
No problem.

377
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,205
Woo-hoo!

378
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:06,314
- Oh, yeah.

379
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:09,614
When you get hit,
you lose the power.

380
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:13,519
Great.

381
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:17,424
Come on. Try again.

382
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:22,330

- But I didn't make it.
- You almost did.

402
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:39,143
No one gets it right away.

403
00:31:39,143 --> 00:31:40,903
How many tries did it take you?

404
00:31:40,903 --> 00:31:43,345
Oh, so many.

405
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:45,215
I was not good at it.

406
00:31:45,215 --> 00:31:46,942
Worse than you.

407
00:31:46,942 --> 00:31:48,449
You got it right away,
didn't you?

408
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,715
I got it right away,
but I grew up here.

409
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:53,520
Okay, now you're just trying
to make me feel better.

410
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,127
No. No.

411
00:31:57,064 --> 00:32:00,032
- Is it working?
- A little bit. Yeah.

412
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:31,360
My army!

413
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,296
- Koopas.
- Yeah!

414
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:34,726
- Goombas.

415
00:32:34,726 --> 00:32:36,860
- Whatever those things are.

416
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,698
After years of searching
for the Super Star,

417
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:42,206
- it is finally ours!
Yeah!

418
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:45,704
I am now the most powerful
turtle in the world!

419
00:32:45,704 --> 00:32:47,145
Yeah!

420
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:49,939
Soon, we will arrive
at the Mushroom Kingdom.

421
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:51,248
Yeah!

422
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:53,679
Where, after years
of being sworn enemies,

423
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,187
I will ask their princess
to marry me

424
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,222
in a fairy-tale wedding!

425
00:32:58,222 --> 00:32:59,817
Yeah!

426
00:32:59,817 --> 00:33:01,291
- Eh?

427
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,194
Yeah.

428
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:05,229
Did he say marry their princess?

429
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:06,923
Doesn't she hate you?

430
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:09,134
Of course she hates me.

431
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:11,796
But that makes me love her
all the more.

432
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:13,963
Her heart-shaped bangs,

433
00:33:13,963 --> 00:33:16,339
the way she floats
in the breeze,

434
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:18,572
her immovable tiara.

435
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:20,574
And when she sees this star...

436
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:23,808
oh, wedding bells.

437
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:26,349
Well, what if she says no?

438
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:30,122
Then I will power up
with this star

439
00:33:30,122 --> 00:33:31,948
and destroy
the Mushroom Kingdom!

440
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:33,389
Yeah!

441
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:36,095
Prepare yourselves
for the best wedding ever.

442
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:38,757
It's gonna rock!

443
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:50,664
They're all counting on us.

444
00:34:50,664 --> 00:34:52,270
No pressure.

445
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,209
Huh?

446
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:08,418
My Toads, our days of terror
are almost over.

447
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:11,520
With the help of the Kong army,
we will stop...

448
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,358
Uh, who's he?

449
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:19,264
He's not important!

450
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:36,809
Nervous?

451
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,316
Who? Me?

452
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,109
- Yes, a little.

454
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:44,080

458
00:35:50,955 --> 00:35:52,792
But are we?

459
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,057
Don't worry.

460
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:57,192
I will protect you.

461
00:35:57,192 --> 00:36:00,503

What?

482
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,771
A report from our intelligence.

483
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:47,808
A mustachioed human has arrived
in the Mushroom Kingdom.

484
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:51,482
The princess has been
training him.

485
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,913
They are up to something, sire.

486
00:37:56,313 --> 00:37:57,785
Sit.

487
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:00,359
Jam with me.

488
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:07,564
This, uh, human,
where did he come from?

489
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:10,369
We... aren't sure.

490
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:12,470
Does the princess like him?

491
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,605
Oh, sire. Look in the mirror.

492
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:17,970
You have nothing to worry about.

493
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,006
I know that. I'm not threatened.

494
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:27,111
Find out who he is
and what they're planning!

495
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:29,619
I'm on it, sire.

496
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:31,786
May I lift the cover?

497
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:32,886
Not yet.

498
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:35,427
- Pain is the best teacher.

499
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,131
Thinking about your brother?

500
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:49,738
We've never been apart
this long.

501
00:38:49,738 --> 00:38:52,675
Don't worry.
We're going to save him.

502
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:11,430
You don't seem like
you're from here.

503
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,191
I don't know where I'm from.

504
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:15,225
Really?

505
00:39:15,225 --> 00:39:16,567
Yep.

506
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,669
My earliest memory is arriving.

507
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:28,645
<i>I was so lucky they found me.</i>

508
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:30,581
<i>They took me in.</i>

509
00:39:32,308 --> 00:39:34,486
<i>Raised me like
one of their own.</i>

510
00:39:34,486 --> 00:39:36,521
<i>And when I was ready...</i>

511
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,086
<i>...they made me their princess.</i>

512
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,257
Hey, maybe you're from my world.

513
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:51,734
There's a huge universe
out there

514
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:54,605
with a lot of galaxies.

515
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:40,552
We found him in the Dark Lands.

516
00:40:45,656 --> 00:40:47,284
Leave him to me.

517
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:58,262
What is your name?

518
00:40:58,262 --> 00:41:00,495
Uh, Luigi.

519
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:03,498
Not sure if you know who I am,

520
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:07,139
but I'm about to marry
a princess and rule the world.

521
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:09,504
Wow, uh...

522
00:41:09,504 --> 00:41:10,813
Yay.

523
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:14,685
But there's one problem, Luigi.

524
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:17,820
There's a human
traveling with my fiancée.

525
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,823
Has a mustache, just like you.

526
00:41:20,823 --> 00:41:22,726
Do you know him?

527
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:24,761
No. No.

528
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:27,027
Ah, a tough one, I see.

529
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,633
Maybe this will get you
to talk.

530
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:30,833
Do you think I know

531
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:31,933
every human being
with a mustache

532
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:33,363
wearing an identical outfit

533
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:35,772
with a hat with the letter
of his first name on it?

534
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:37,367
- Because I don't.

535
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:40,810
- Do you know him?!
- Stop!

536
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,746
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I know him.

537
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:44,946
Yes, I know him.
Yeah, he's my brother Mario,

538
00:41:44,946 --> 00:41:47,586
and he's the best guy
in the world.

539
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:50,050
Do princesses
find him attractive?

540
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,789
They do if they have good taste!

541
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:56,122
Get him out of my sight!

542
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:58,256
We'll see how tough
this Mario is

543
00:41:58,256 --> 00:42:00,830
when he watches me
kill his brother!

544
00:42:13,304 --> 00:42:15,339
Where am I?

545
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:20,575
Home.

546
00:42:20,575 --> 00:42:23,017
Pay him no heed.

547
00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:26,581
He is cute, but he is...

548
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:30,794
In an insane world, it is
the sane who is called crazy.

549
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:37,130
How long you guys been in here?

550
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,035
Time, like hope, is an illusion.

551
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:42,938
Please!
We are depressed enough!

552
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:45,743
There's got to be
a way out of here.

553
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,107
There is no escape.

554
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:50,407
The only hope is
the sweet relief of death.

555
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:54,477
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

556
00:43:18,338 --> 00:43:19,568
You ready?

557
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:21,372
Eh... sure.

558
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:31,789
What?

559
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:33,956
How you doing?

560
00:43:33,956 --> 00:43:36,728
We are here to see the king.

561
00:43:39,258 --> 00:43:41,161
Follow me.

562
00:43:42,032 --> 00:43:43,526

a sports coat.

Yes, Your Highness.

585
00:45:25,727 --> 00:45:27,135
Without your help,

586
00:45:27,135 --> 00:45:29,467
the Mushroom Kingdom
will be annihilated.

worthy of fighting alongside

588
00:45:35,176 --> 00:45:40,181
the greatest army in the world?

589
00:45:40,181 --> 00:45:42,051
Because we have heart.

590
00:45:42,051 --> 00:45:45,648
And with your strength,
we can win.

591
00:45:45,648 --> 00:45:47,287
Okay, fine.

592
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,652
- That's it?
- No, that's not it.

593
00:45:49,652 --> 00:45:52,259
The answer is no. Goodbye.

594
00:45:52,259 --> 00:45:56,032

the Jungle Kingdom is next.

Hey.

673
00:52:34,562 --> 00:52:36,564
...and you just kept
getting back up?

674
00:52:36,564 --> 00:52:38,192
You just don't know
when to quit.

675
00:52:38,192 --> 00:52:39,534
Huh.

676
00:52:39,534 --> 00:52:41,272
Well, never thought of that
as a good thing.

00:52:41,272 --> 00:52:43,197
It's a great thing.

00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:45,166
Thanks. I...

679
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,201
I let him win,
just for the record.

680
00:52:47,201 --> 00:52:49,478
Really, though?
Why would you do that?

681
00:52:49,478 --> 00:52:51,007
You want to know why? It's...

682

685
00:52:59,754 --> 00:53:01,919
We've located Bowser's ship.

686
00:53:01,919 --> 00:53:06,429
He's gonna arrive at the
Mushroom Kingdom by sundown.

687
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:10,191
Lucky for you guys,
I got a shortcut.

688
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:12,831
We beat him there
and ambush him.

Yeah, I know.

690
00:53:15,064 --> 00:53:19,277

and the mustachioed human.

716
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:37,910
He has defeated Donkey Kong
and won the Kong army.

717

Peach was super impressed?

718

It appears so, yes.

719

They are heading toward
their secret passage.

720
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,886
Oh, they think
they can surprise me, huh?

721
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:49,460
Two can play at that game.

722
00:56:10,879 --> 00:56:15,112
Um, no one panic,
but the road is about to end.

723
00:56:15,112 --> 00:56:18,984

step on the gas and buckle up!

00:56:54,657 --> 00:56:56,450
Is there anything like this

728
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,419
- in your world?

729
00:56:58,419 --> 00:56:59,827
No.

730
00:56:59,827 --> 00:57:01,763
We don't drive on rainbows.

731
00:57:01,763 --> 00:57:03,457
What are you gonna tell me next?

732
00:57:03,457 --> 00:57:05,668
That the turtles aren't evil?

733
00:57:05,668 --> 00:57:07,934
No, no. They're usually pets.

734
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:09,133
No way.

735
00:57:09,133 --> 00:57:11,168
Ah, come to Brooklyn.
I'll buy you a turtle.

736
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,940
Maybe I will.

737
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,239
- Dude, is this you flirting?

738
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:17,713
This is painful.

739
00:57:17,713 --> 00:57:19,407
Just-- I was trying to be nice.

740
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:20,683
You are so embarrassing.

741
00:57:20,683 --> 00:57:22,520
A princess would never
go out with you.

742
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,050
Yes, she would.
I guarantee she would.

743
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:27,151
Guys, enough.

744
00:57:27,151 --> 00:57:29,120
All right, all right.

745
00:57:37,636 --> 00:57:39,702
Attack!

746
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:50,075
It's an ambush!

747
00:57:52,913 --> 00:57:55,179
Defensive positions!

748
00:58:10,735 --> 00:58:12,702
Mario, you're a dead man.

749
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:18,235
Split up!

750
00:58:20,437 --> 00:58:22,107
Mario!

751
00:58:43,702 --> 00:58:45,702
- Whoa!

752
00:58:47,264 --> 00:58:49,002
Whoa.

753
00:59:38,381 --> 00:59:40,922
I'm too cute to die!

754
00:59:49,898 --> 00:59:52,868
That is how you princess!

755
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,508
Time to die, Mario.

756
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:24,834
Ow!

757
01:00:27,432 --> 01:00:29,564
- See ya!

758
01:00:29,564 --> 01:00:31,005
No!

759
01:00:34,472 --> 01:00:36,571
Woo-hoo!

760
01:00:36,571 --> 01:00:38,342
Yeah!

761
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:47,791
You can't escape me.

762
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:48,891
What?

763
01:00:48,891 --> 01:00:51,861
Blue shell!

764
01:01:06,172 --> 01:01:08,174
No!

765
01:01:08,174 --> 01:01:09,978
No, Mario.

766
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,608
Aah! No.

767
01:01:13,608 --> 01:01:14,752
No!

768
01:01:14,752 --> 01:01:16,886
Whoa!

769
01:01:19,682 --> 01:01:22,859
Get your clown claws off of me!

770
01:01:25,653 --> 01:01:27,765
Goodbye, Mario.

771
01:01:27,765 --> 01:01:30,196
We have to get home.

772
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,568
Hey, this is your fault!

773
01:01:39,568 --> 01:01:41,570
- My fault? You're the one who...
- Stop talking!

774
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:44,782
I don't want the last thing
I hear before I die

775
01:01:44,782 --> 01:01:46,378
to be your...

776
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:19,080
Mario, you saved my life.

777
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,247
Yeah, well, I won't tell anyone.

778
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:22,820
Good. Please don't.

779
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,052
Okay.

780
01:02:25,779 --> 01:02:29,255
Uh, did you just feel something?

781
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,061
Swim!

782
01:02:49,574 --> 01:02:51,079
Bowser's on his way.

783
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:52,883
You have to evacuate.

784
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:58,449
Hurry. Get out of the city!

785
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,463
Princess?

786
01:03:12,463 --> 01:03:14,168
We lost the army.

787
01:03:14,168 --> 01:03:16,665
- And Mario's gone.

788
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:20,372
Bowser is coming.

789
01:03:20,372 --> 01:03:23,177
Head into the forest.
I'll buy you some time.

790
01:03:23,177 --> 01:03:25,575
You heard her.
Evacuate the city.

791
01:03:27,049 --> 01:03:29,084
Go with the others.

792
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:31,988
I said I wouldn't let
anyone hurt you.

793
01:03:36,456 --> 01:03:37,356
Run!

794
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:43,934
Just leave it. There's no time.

795
01:04:38,914 --> 01:04:40,848
Princess Peach.

796
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:43,059
Brave as ever.

797
01:04:44,997 --> 01:04:49,032
As you can see,
I have the Super Star.

798
01:04:49,032 --> 01:04:53,399
If you're going to use it,
use it now.

799
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:57,370
No, Princess.

800
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:59,768
I stole this star for us.

801
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:03,442
I guess love really makes a guy
come out of his shell.

802
01:05:06,744 --> 01:05:08,810
I told you that line
wouldn't work.

803
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:10,581
You're doing great.

804
01:05:10,581 --> 01:05:15,256
Peaches, with this star,
we will be invincible.

805
01:05:15,256 --> 01:05:19,788
We can rule the world
together forever.

806
01:05:19,788 --> 01:05:21,691
Will you marry me?

807
01:05:21,691 --> 01:05:23,198
Marry you?

808
01:05:23,198 --> 01:05:24,859
Are you insane?

809
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:26,960
I would never marry you.

810
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,799
Maybe you should reconsider.

811
01:05:32,603 --> 01:05:33,802
No!

812
01:05:33,802 --> 01:05:35,177
Stop!

813
01:05:37,014 --> 01:05:38,246
Please stop.

814
01:05:38,246 --> 01:05:39,412
I'll... I'll-I'll marry you.

815
01:05:39,412 --> 01:05:41,315
Just don't hurt my Toads.

816
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:48,157
You have my word.

817
01:05:55,232 --> 01:05:57,958
Time for a wedding!

818
01:06:10,379 --> 01:06:12,313
♪ Life is sad ♪

819
01:06:12,313 --> 01:06:14,117
♪ Prison is sad ♪

820
01:06:14,117 --> 01:06:19,012
♪ Life in prison
is very, very sad. ♪

821
01:06:25,326 --> 01:06:28,428
Ooh, fresh meat for the grinder.

822
01:06:28,428 --> 01:06:31,068
Who's this ray of sunshine?

823
01:06:31,068 --> 01:06:34,137
There's no sunshine,
only darkness.

824
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:36,172
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

825
01:06:36,172 --> 01:06:38,438
Hello, prisoners.

826
01:06:38,438 --> 01:06:40,275
You don't deserve this,

827
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:43,476
but you're invited
to the royal wedding!

828
01:06:43,476 --> 01:06:45,280
Yay!

829
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,350
Where you will all be
ritualistically sacrificed!

830
01:06:51,748 --> 01:06:53,651
Oh, no, no, no.

831
01:06:53,651 --> 01:06:56,049
Finally, mercy.

832
01:06:57,457 --> 01:06:59,558
Mario.

833
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:13,209
So this is the end.

834
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:14,903
Being slowly digested
by an eel,

835
01:07:14,903 --> 01:07:17,114
next to an idiot in overalls.

836
01:07:17,114 --> 01:07:20,117
Well, at least your brother
isn't gonna die because of you.

837
01:07:20,117 --> 01:07:21,382
At least you're not gonna die

838
01:07:21,382 --> 01:07:22,746
with your dad thinking
you're a joke.

839
01:07:22,746 --> 01:07:25,848
Yeah, well, my dad thinks
I'm a joke, too.

840
01:07:25,848 --> 01:07:27,850
Yeah? Well...

841
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:28,983
your dad's right!

842
01:07:28,983 --> 01:07:30,391
You know what?
I feel bad enough.

843
01:07:30,391 --> 01:07:31,854
Just-just leave me alone.

844
01:07:31,854 --> 01:07:34,428
I've never met your dad,
but he sounds brilliant.

845
01:07:34,428 --> 01:07:37,827
Just go in a corner and smash
some stuff, smash monkey!

846
01:07:38,993 --> 01:07:43,096
I am more than a guy

847
01:07:43,096 --> 01:07:45,142
who smashes things!

848
01:08:12,763 --> 01:08:16,239
- That was amazing!
- Now we're even!

849
01:08:45,202 --> 01:08:47,061
Princess, I got it.

850
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:48,667
Great job.

851
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:51,131
Couldn't have you going
out there without your bouquet.

852
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:52,572
It's perfect.

853
01:09:19,502 --> 01:09:22,338
I'll be sacrificing them
in your honor.

854
01:09:23,308 --> 01:09:25,132
Lower the prisoners!

855
01:09:32,449 --> 01:09:34,449
Dearly belov...

856
01:09:34,449 --> 01:09:36,319
- Huh?

857
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,519
- Drama.

858
01:09:38,519 --> 01:09:41,115
You really thought
I'd marry you?

859
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:43,018
Kinda.

860
01:09:43,018 --> 01:09:45,658
I'd never marry a monster.

861
01:09:46,694 --> 01:09:49,695
Then we are breaking up
right now!

862
01:10:15,052 --> 01:10:16,656
They got to be up there.

863
01:10:19,254 --> 01:10:21,056
Fire!

864
01:10:28,703 --> 01:10:31,770
- You want to do this?
- Yes, I do.

865
01:10:41,045 --> 01:10:42,649
Yes! Fire!

866
01:10:57,259 --> 01:10:59,435
Woo-hoo!

867
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:01,635
This is fun!

868
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,868
Ha! Loser!

869
01:11:07,808 --> 01:11:10,072
Hey, what does this do?

870
01:11:10,072 --> 01:11:12,206
Whoa!

871
01:11:12,206 --> 01:11:14,417
- Whoa. Yeah.

872
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:17,651
Whoa.

873
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:20,489
Cool raccoon suit.

874
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:22,788
- Really?
- Not at all.

875
01:11:55,152 --> 01:11:57,086
Whee!

876
01:12:01,761 --> 01:12:04,159
- Huh?

877
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:11,067
Whew.

878
01:12:11,067 --> 01:12:12,475
Boo.

879
01:12:22,245 --> 01:12:24,487
Huh?

880
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:27,347
- Lu!
- Mario?

881
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:31,890
I told you. See?

882
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:35,927
As long as we're together,
everything is gonna be okay.

883
01:12:38,798 --> 01:12:41,262
Mario, why do you look
like a bear? What is this?

884
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:46,839
You did good, kid.

885
01:12:46,839 --> 01:12:49,677
Make your pecs dance.
You deserve it.

886
01:12:49,677 --> 01:12:52,515
No time now. Definitely later.

887
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:06,496
Launch the Bomber Bill

888
01:13:06,496 --> 01:13:09,928
and destroy
the Mushroom Kingdom!

889
01:13:20,908 --> 01:13:22,875
No.

890
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:32,115
Hey, hey. Hey, over here.

891
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:45,095
You asked for it.

892
01:13:53,171 --> 01:13:54,808
Hello.

893
01:14:14,597 --> 01:14:16,896
Ow!

894
01:14:18,636 --> 01:14:20,163
Really?

895
01:14:25,005 --> 01:14:27,038
Follow me.

896
01:14:31,374 --> 01:14:33,583
Come on.

897
01:14:34,784 --> 01:14:37,048
Little closer.

898
01:14:38,313 --> 01:14:42,218
Mamma mia!

899
01:14:52,637 --> 01:14:54,868
- Huh?

900
01:15:20,828 --> 01:15:22,632
- That's beautiful.
- You made these, right?

901
01:15:25,131 --> 01:15:27,703
- Huh? Whoa.

902
01:15:46,757 --> 01:15:48,790
Huh?

903
01:15:49,518 --> 01:15:50,825
Brooklyn?

904
01:15:52,387 --> 01:15:53,520
Mario?

905
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:57,293
- You almost dented my...

906
01:16:27,391 --> 01:16:30,062
Mario!

907
01:16:34,671 --> 01:16:36,398
You want this?

908
01:16:48,685 --> 01:16:50,445
You ruined my wedding!

909
01:16:50,445 --> 01:16:53,382
I was finally gonna be happy!

910
01:16:55,056 --> 01:16:58,761
- Now you will suffer!

911
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:01,357
Like me!

912
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:18,671
You really thought
you could stop me?

913
01:17:18,671 --> 01:17:21,883
You worthless,
weak little nothing.

914
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:23,885
Come out and fight!

915
01:17:23,885 --> 01:17:26,250
Or are you too scared?

916
01:17:30,551 --> 01:17:32,058
Just what I thought.

917
01:17:50,747 --> 01:17:52,672
MARIO and LUIGI
Mamma mia!

918
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:55,114
That's why the Sup-Super
Mario Brothers are here.

919
01:17:55,114 --> 01:17:57,611
A-to save Brooklyn...
save Brooklyn...

920
01:17:57,611 --> 01:18:00,218
Brooklyn... save Brooklyn.

921
01:18:17,974 --> 01:18:20,139
Let's-a go.

922
01:18:25,045 --> 01:18:26,574
Hey.

923
01:18:27,643 --> 01:18:29,181
Leave him alone.

924
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:31,447
Mario?

925
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:34,417
You just don't know
when to quit.

926
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:35,649
Yeah.

927
01:18:35,649 --> 01:18:37,354
I've been told that before.

928
01:18:40,491 --> 01:18:41,688
Mario!

929
01:18:44,902 --> 01:18:46,968
The star!

930
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:49,069
No! That's mine!

931
01:19:09,388 --> 01:19:10,486
Lu.

932
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:15,458
Nothing can hurt us
as long as we're together.

933
01:19:26,405 --> 01:19:27,536
No!

934
01:19:41,519 --> 01:19:42,518
Huh?

935
01:19:48,425 --> 01:19:51,164
- Rip them to pieces!

936
01:20:02,947 --> 01:20:04,375
Oh, hey, Spike.

937
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:05,673
Luigi?

938
01:20:20,459 --> 01:20:22,162
- No!

939
01:20:22,758 --> 01:20:25,000
Mamma mia.

940
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:17,646
Peaches.

941
01:21:17,646 --> 01:21:20,187
Uh, listen, this is not
the way I pictured it,

942
01:21:20,187 --> 01:21:22,354
but give me one more chance.

943
01:21:22,354 --> 01:21:24,422
Ew, no.

944
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,886
No, no, no, no, n...

945
01:21:26,886 --> 01:21:28,756
Hey! Hey!

946
01:21:28,756 --> 01:21:30,296
That is not cool!

947
01:21:30,296 --> 01:21:32,331
Ha! He got the blue mushroom!

948
01:21:32,331 --> 01:21:34,795
Eh? I told you I'd get you
a pet turtle.

949
01:21:34,795 --> 01:21:38,007
Not bad, Mustache.

950
01:21:38,007 --> 01:21:41,043
And, Luigi, you're so brave.

951
01:21:41,043 --> 01:21:42,440
Oh. Thanks, uh...

952
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,112
Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

953
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:46,840
Oh, my boys, my heroes!

954
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,545
Woo-hoo!

955
01:21:48,545 --> 01:21:52,582
Mario, you were amazing.

956
01:21:52,582 --> 01:21:55,090
Thanks, Dad.

957
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:57,125
- Ah, bring it in!

958
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:06,860
Let's hear it for
the Super Mario Brothers!

959
01:22:16,608 --> 01:22:19,048

960
01:22:19,048 --> 01:22:20,874
