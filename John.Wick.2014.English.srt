1
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,890
<i>It looks like the storm has passed.</i>

2
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,976
<i>New Yorkers, a season high,
seven inches of rain last night.</i>

3
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:47,280
<i>High winds and flooding in some areas
even left some New Yorkers stranded.</i>

4
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,849
<i>City crews still working this morning.</i>

5
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:52,101
<i>They're trying to restore power
to several areas in the boroughs.</i>

6
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:56,018
<i>Good news is, today should be
sunny with highs in the low 60s.</i>

7
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:00,934
<i>Relentless weather these past few weeks.</i>

8
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:04,430
<i>So get out there, enjoy the sun,
go to the park, get outside if you can,</i>

9
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,100
<i>because it's not gonna last long.</i>

10
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,465
<i>What are you doing, John?</i>

11
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,901
<i>Looking at you.</i>

12
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,253
<i>Come here.</i>

13
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,144
<i>Are you still filming?</i>

14
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,772
<i>Just an anniversary...</i>

15
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,201
It's been a while.

16
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,404
My condolences.

17
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,497
How're you holdin' up?

18
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,806
I keep asking "Why her?"

19
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,183
There's no rhyme or reason to this life.

20
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,417
It's days like today
scattered among the rest.

21
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,679
Are you sure?

22
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:24,879
Don't blame yourself.

23
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,761
What are you really doing here, Marcus?

24
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,500
Just checkin' up on an old friend.

25
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,642
Goodbye, John.

26
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,612
- John Wick?
- Yes.

27
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,412
Sign here, please.

28
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,888
And the pen.

29
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,559
Sorry.

30
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,958
- Here you go. Good night.
- Thanks.

31
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,561
<i>"John, I'm sorry I can't
be there for you.</i>

32
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,132
<i>"But you still need something,
someone, to love.</i>

33
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:17,437
<i>"So start with this.
Because the car doesn't count.</i>

34
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,908
<i>"I love you, John. This illness
has loomed over us for a long time,</i>

35
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,545
<i>"and now that I have found
my peace, find yours.</i>

36
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:30,180
<i>"Until that day,
your best friend, Helen."</i>

37
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,018
Hey.

38
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,123
Hey.

39
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,131
Daisy.

40
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,332
Of course.

41
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,172
Hey.

42
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,479
Come on.

43
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,675
I'm up. I'm up...

44
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,309
I'm up. I'm up.

45
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,962
Hey!

46
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,166
Oh. Right.

47
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:43,747
What?

48
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,995
We'll grab you some kibble later.

49
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,250
Nice ride.

50
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,822
Mustang. Boss 429.

51
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:36,462
- She a '70?
- '69.

52
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,899
Beautiful car.

53
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,264
Thanks.

54
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,972
- How much?
- Excuse me?

55
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,338
How much for the car?

56
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:51,141
She's not for sale.

57
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,848
Oh, I love dogs.

58
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,494
You have good day, sir.

59
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,185
All right, come on, then.

60
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,991
How you doin'?

61
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,538
You need to go?

62
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,173
Yo, Aurelio!

63
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,045
I want a new VIN number
and some clean papers.

64
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,081
Where'd you get that car?

65
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,868
Is it here?

66
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,481
It was.

67
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:09,040
- I asked you where the hell did you get it?
- Who gives a shit?

68
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:12,020
<i>Iosef Tarasov nicked it.</i>

69
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:14,124
Viggo's son.

70
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,561
Yeah.

71
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,201
All right, get out of here. Just get
out of my shop. Get out right now.

72
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,169
Did you just lose your shit, Aurelio?

73
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,070
Because we own you.

74
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,246
What did you say?
What did you say to me?

75
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,112
We own you.

76
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:41,051
You don't own me, punk.
I work with your father, all right?

77
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,624
The owner of that car,
did you kill him or what?

78
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:49,295
No. I sure as hell fucked up his dog.

79
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,897
You fucked up his dog? That's what
you did? You fucked up his dog?

80
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,567
- Yeah...
- That's crazy shit, man.

81
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,574
Aw, look at you. That's great.

82
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,144
You're gonna come into my shop
and you're gonna pull a gun on me.

83
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,479
That's great, man. Come on!

84
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:12,616
Now, either you kill me right now
or you get the fuck outta my shop!

85
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,890
Viggo is not gonna like this.

86
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,760
How do you know what
Viggo likes or doesn't like?

87
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,159
I'll tell you somethin'
he's gonna understand.

88
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,666
You've got a fuckin'
pair on you, old man!

89
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,171
I guess we'll be takin' our
business someplace else.

90
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,110
<i>So what are you gonna do?</i>

91
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,926
I need a ride.

92
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,007
Aurelio speaking.

93
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,978
I heard you struck my son.

94
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,517
- <i>Yes sir, I did.</i>
- And may I ask why?

95
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,321
Yeah. Well, because he stole
John Wick's car, sir.

96
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,069
And...

97
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:25,752
killed his dog.

98
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,228
Viggo?

99
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,663
Yeah?

100
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,299
They've agreed to your terms.

101
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,567
I mean, it's not like you gave them
much of a choice anyway, though, right?

102
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,138
Congratulations.

103
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:19,609
Sir?

104
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,980
Have you seen my son?

105
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,035
How was your trip, kid?

106
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,771
We won't be hearing
from them anytime soon.

107
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,637
Or ever.

108
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,732
That's a nice jacket.

109
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,831
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

110
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,679
Should I go?

111
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,321
- Viggo, English, please. Come on...
- Stay, God damn it!

112
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,125
What did I do?

113
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,128
We did what you asked. No one saw shit.

114
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,668
I'm not talking about Atlantic City.

115
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,738
What, then?

116
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,974
You mean Aurelio's?
So I stole a fucking car!

117
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,442
Aw, fuck, Viggo!

118
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,175
- Right, I'll go...
- You stay!

119
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,469
It's not what you did, son,
that angers me so.

120
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:28,238
- It's who you did it to.
- Who? The fucking nobody!

121
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,708
That fuckin' nobody...

122
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,578
is John Wick.

123
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:53,363
<i>He once was an associate of ours.</i>

124
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,567
They call him Baba Yaga.

125
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:04,274
- The Boogeyman?
- Well, John wasn't exactly The Boogeyman.

126
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:12,315
He was the one you sent to
kill the fucking Boogeyman.

127
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,490
John is a man of focus,

128
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:22,926
commitment,

129
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:24,961
sheer will.

130
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:29,298
Something you know very little about.

131
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,136
I once saw him kill three men in a bar.

132
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,741
With a pencil.

133
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,577
With a fuckin'...

134
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:43,479
...pencil.

135
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,757
Then suddenly one day he asked to leave.

136
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,894
It's over a woman, of course.

137
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,035
<i>So I made a deal with him.</i>

138
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,840
I gave him an impossible task.

139
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:15,211
A job no one could have pulled off.

140
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,720
The bodies he buried that day

141
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,558
laid the foundation of what we are now.

142
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,064
And then, my son,

143
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,334
a few days after his wife died,

144
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,970
you steal his car

145
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,910
and kill his fuckin' dog.

146
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,710
Father, I can make this right.

147
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,551
- How do you plan that?
- By finishing what I started.

148
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,951
What the... Did he hear
a fucking word I said?

149
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,189
Iosef! Iosef! Listen!

150
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,328
John will come for you.

151
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,773
And you will do nothing,
because you can do nothing.

152
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,907
So get the fuck out of my sight!

153
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,637
<i>Hello, John.</i>

154
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,444
I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry.
My condolences.

155
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,771
<i>It... seems to be fate,</i>

156
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,368
<i>or happenstance or just bad fuckin' luck</i>

157
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:06,315
<i>caused our paths to cross once again.</i>

158
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,161
John?

159
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,438
Let us not resort to our baser instincts

160
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:23,973
<i>and handle this like
civilized men, to move on...</i>

161
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,285
What'd he say?

162
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,757
- Enough.
- Oh, God.

163
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:46,863
Task your crew.

164
00:27:48,663 --> 00:27:51,968
- How many?
- How many do you have?

165
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,456
- Evenin', John.
- Evenin', Jimmy.

166
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,523
Noise complaint?

167
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,361
Noise complaint.

168
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,307
- You, workin' again?
- No, just sortin' some stuff out.

169
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,244
Well...

170
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:32,514
I'll leave you be, then.

171
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,851
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Jimmy.

172
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,372
This is Wick.

173
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,941
Yes, John Wick, that's right.

174
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,275
I'd like to make a dinner
reservation for 12.

175
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,628
Good to see you, John.

176
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,664
Charlie.

177
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,611
You look good.

178
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,815
And here I'd feared
you'd left all this behind.

179
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,359
Will I be hearin' from you anytime soon?

180
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,129
Goodbye, Charlie.

181
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,865
John.

182
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,071
Of course he did.

183
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,678
Put a contract on John Wick.

184
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,045
- How much?
- Two million.

185
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,521
English, Viggo, please.

186
00:34:56,127 --> 00:35:00,562
Put Iosef in the Red Circle and wait.

187
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,368
For what?

188
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,335
For John Wick, of course.

189
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,828
Thank you.

190
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,901
To what do I owe this visit?

191
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,971
I have a job for you.

192
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,376
And I've got a phone.

193
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,415
I want to offer you this face to face

194
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:54,716
seeing as how you
might find it personal.

195
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,388
Would you kill John Wick
for two million dollars?

196
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,594
After all, you were close.

197
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:10,669
- Is the contract exclusive?
- No, it's open.

198
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:14,035
It's a timely matter,
it has to be handled quickly.

199
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,305
Consider it done.

200
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,097
Thank you, Marcus.
I know I can trust you.

201
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:23,078
Thanks for the drink.

202
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:30,973
- Room 918. Do enjoy your stay.
- Thanks.

203
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,676
Good seeing you again, John.

204
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,045
Perkins.

205
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,586
I have you for two nights.

206
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:45,390
- Depending on business, it may be more.
- Of course, sir.

207
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,123
So when did the old place
get a facelift?

208
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,295
Around four years ago.

209
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:53,398
But I assure you, sir,
she really hasn't changed much.

210
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,465
- Same owner?
- Same owner.

211
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:05,774
Room 818.

212
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:09,060
And, as always,

213
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:15,550
it is a pleasure having you
with us again, Mr. Wick.

214
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,300
<i>What are you doing, John?</i>

215
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,003
<i>Looking at you.</i>

216
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,572
<i>Come here.</i>

217
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,100
Hello, Winston.

218
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,804
Jonathan.

219
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,577
Now, as I recall,

220
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:23,948
weren't you the one tasked to dole out
the beatings, not receive them?

221
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,647
Rusty, I guess.

222
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,450
To what do we owe the pleasure?

223
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,154
Iosef Tarasov.

224
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,924
- What about him?
- I'd like to talk with him.

225
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:40,028
A talk, you say.

226
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,900
I'm familiar with
the parlance, Jonathan.

227
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,072
I want to ask you this.

228
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,438
Have you returned to the fold?

229
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,511
Just visiting.

230
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,213
Have you thought this through?

231
00:41:55,813 --> 00:42:00,115
I mean, chewed down to the bone?

232
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,221
You got out once.

233
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:06,321
You dip so much as a pinky
back into this pond,

234
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:11,062
you may well find something reaches out

235
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,831
and drags you back into its depths.

236
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,897
Where do I find him?

237
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,401
Hey.

238
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,037
Wick's at The Continental.

239
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,111
Welcome home, John.

240
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,944
We have a contact there who's
willing to take him out for us.

241
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,979
Yeah?

242
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,849
How brazen.

243
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,824
If they're willing to break the rules
of Continental, double the bounty.

244
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,260
You know the rules.

245
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,683
No business can be conducted
on these premises lest

246
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:48,715
incurring heavy penalties.

247
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,268
Have a drink

248
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,972
and relax.

249
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,022
For now.

250
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:06,214
It's personal.

251
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,625
Holy shit! Jonathan!

252
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,894
- Hey, Addy.
- My God!

253
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,999
- How long has it been? Four years?
- Five and change.

254
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,835
So tell me, how was
life on the other side?

255
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,259
It was good, Addy.

256
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:29,170
Far better than I deserved.

257
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,575
- Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your...
- Thanks.

258
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,479
I've never seen you like this.

259
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,047
Like what?

260
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,650
Vulnerable.

261
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,956
- I'm retired.
- Not if you're drinkin' here, you're not.

262
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,161
- Usual?
- Please.

263
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,401
Compliments of the house.

264
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,737
Thanks.

265
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,102
Did you see the tits on that girl?

266
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,174
Better hope Lita is working tonight.

267
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:35,926
Are you scared of the fuckin' boogeyman?

268
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,965
- I'm not.
- No.

269
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:40,962
But you should be.

270
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,368
I want another bottle!

271
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:51,706
Right fuckin' now! Go get me a bottle!

272
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,875
Come on!

273
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,918
Hello, Francis.

274
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,387
Mr. Wick.

275
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,164
Are you here on business, sir?

276
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,900
Afraid so, Francis.

277
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,436
Why don't you take the night off.

278
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,877
Thank you, sir.

279
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,509
Fuck you, motherfucker!

280
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,318
Where is Iosef?

281
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,125
Bath house, downstairs.

282
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:20,348
Go!

283
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,017
John Wick's there. Go get him!

284
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:53,108
Move! He's here! He's fucking here!
He's there! He's coming!

285
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,510
Get in! Get in!

286
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,180
Come on, come on!

287
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:25,188
- Good evening, Mr. Wick.
- Good evening.

288
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:28,091
- How may I be of service?
- Is the doctor in?

289
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:30,887
- Yes, sir. 24/7.
- Then send him up, please.

290
00:55:30,987 --> 00:55:33,161
- Yes, sir.
- How good's your laundry?

291
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,032
I'm sorry to say that
no one's that good.

292
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,471
No. I thought not.

293
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:44,374
May I suggest a drink, sir.

294
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,673
Bourbon, perhaps.

295
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,543
That sounds perfect.

296
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,862
So what sort of movement
am I looking at?

297
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,398
Well, if you're lookin' to heal,

298
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:10,135
then keep it marginal.

299
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:16,737
However, if you still have
business to attend to,

300
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,475
take two of these beforehand.

301
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:25,980
Your stitches'll tear and you'll bleed,

302
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:29,019
but you'll have full function.

303
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,085
Do you need anything for the pain?

304
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,755
No, I've got that covered.

305
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:42,824
Hey, John.

306
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,663
- Perkins?
- I thought I'd let myself in.

307
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,156
I noticed.

308
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,412
I never knew Ms. Perkins to get
out of bed for less than three.

309
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,281
Viggo's giving me four
to break hotel rules.

310
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:06,747
That's unwise, I assure you.

311
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,757
You were always a pussy.

312
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:31,398
Yes?

313
00:59:31,498 --> 00:59:34,704
<i>I apologize for calling you
at this hour, but...</i>

314
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:40,141
we have received a number of grievances
from your floor concerning the noise.

315
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,515
My apologies. I was dealing with...

316
00:59:45,885 --> 00:59:49,386
- an uninvited guest.
<i>- Have you need then of, say,</i>

317
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,721
a dinner reservation, perhaps?

318
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,624
Perhaps. I'll have to get back to you.

319
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,598
No!

320
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,670
- Where's Iosef?
- Fuck you.

321
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,229
- Where's Viggo?
- I'm not telling you shit!

322
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,008
Do you really wanna die here, Perkins?

323
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,177
Give me somethin'.

324
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:25,589
Little Russia.
There's a church near Cannon Court.

325
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,358
- <i>What about it?</i>
- <i>It's a front.</i>

326
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,324
It's where Viggo keeps
his private stash.

327
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,061
Thank you.

328
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,970
Do I know you?

329
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,173
I'm thinkin' so.

330
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:56,586
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Harry.

331
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,221
Everything all right?

332
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:01,655
Yeah. Everything's fine.

333
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:05,259
- I'll leave you to it, then.
- Hey, Harry?

334
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:10,300
You keen on earning a coin?
Babysittin' the sleepin' one?

335
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,400
- Catch and release?
- Catch and release.

336
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,267
My son, how might I help you?

337
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,109
Motherfucker!

338
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,885
Let's go to the vault.

339
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,001
Open it.

340
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,210
Viggo will kill me.

341
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,962
Ladies, out.

342
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,748
Honestly, what do you think you're
going to do with all of that?

343
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:06,912
This.

344
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,798
Don't worry.

345
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,801
Housekeeping will find you.

346
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,406
Treat all your ladies like this?

347
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:07,107
You are no lady. Trust me.

348
01:04:13,582 --> 01:04:15,782
Harry, is it?

349
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,487
How'd you like to earn more
than just a gold coin?

350
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:28,165
You've broken the rules. You've done
business on Continental grounds.

351
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:33,800
And management does not take
kindly to that sort of behavior.

352
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,937
Fuck management.

353
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,280
Don't worry. Housekeeping will find you.

354
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:55,189
Ashes to ashes.

355
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:57,460
Can we recover from this?

356
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,928
Viggo, you know what
was in that vault, right?

357
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,729
It was nothing.

358
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,466
Shit!

359
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:24,785
Come on!

360
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:44,601
I'll say this, John.

361
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:48,068
They sure as fuck broke
the mold with you.

362
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,973
Ay, ay...

363
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:03,920
You always had a certain...

364
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,421
...audacity about you, you know.

365
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,624
Right? Oh, yeah.

366
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:18,765
I can say you're still very
much the John Wick of old.

367
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:21,368
Am I?

368
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:28,074
People don't change. You know that.

369
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,777
Times, they do.

370
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,576
Do you know what was in that vault?

371
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,191
Artwork, cash, not without its worth,
but the leverage I had on this city,

372
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:47,861
audio recordings, physical evidence,
blackmail, it was fuckin' priceless!

373
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:50,397
Priceless!

374
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:55,639
Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that.

375
01:07:57,684 --> 01:08:00,704
Yeah, I know you did. Yeah.

376
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,847
Are you really laughing?

377
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,818
So...

378
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:18,024
Then you got married? Settled down.

379
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:20,994
How did you manage that anyways?

380
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:22,930
Luck, I guess.

381
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,702
Yeah.

382
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:29,038
Yeah, while you had your wife,
I had my son.

383
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:33,006
And believe me,
you had a far better deal.

384
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,182
And then you left.

385
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,517
And the way you got out,

386
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:44,659
lying to yourself that the past

387
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:48,866
held no sway over the future.
But in the end,

388
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:55,331
a lot of us are rewarded
for our misdeeds,

389
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:59,166
which is why God took your wife

390
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:03,570
and unleashed you upon me.

391
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,423
This life...

392
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:10,032
follows you.

393
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,083
It clings to you,

394
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:19,222
infecting everyone who
comes close to you.

395
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:22,722
We are cursed, you and I.

396
01:09:23,892 --> 01:09:27,227
On that we agree.

397
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,333
Finally, common ground.

398
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:37,673
- Okay.
- Step aside.

399
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:40,303
Give me your son.

400
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:43,142
John Wick.

401
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:51,954
It was just a fucking car!
Just a fuckin' dog!

402
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,887
Just a dog...

403
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,790
Viggo?

404
01:09:58,293 --> 01:10:01,562
- Yeah.
- When Helen died, I lost everything.

405
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:05,902
Until that dog arrived on my doorstep.

406
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,838
A final gift from my wife.

407
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:13,406
In that moment, I received
some semblance of hope.

408
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:18,578
An opportunity to grieve unalone.

409
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,282
And your son

410
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,286
took that from me!

411
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:27,390
- Oh, come on...
- Stole that from me!

412
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:30,259
Killed that from me!

413
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,895
People keep asking if I'm back.

414
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:35,698
And I haven't really had an answer.

415
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:39,202
But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back!

416
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:42,405
So you can either hand over your son...

417
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:46,175
or you can die screaming alongside him!

418
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,165
Cool it, cool it, cool it,
cool it, cool it!

419
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:27,734
John!

420
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:31,271
- Where is he?
- Shit.

421
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,974
Shit!

422
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:41,384
I have your word that
if I tell you where he is,

423
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:45,051
- you'll let me walk away?
- Pull the contract.

424
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:50,691
Done.

425
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:58,334
He's kept in a safe house. Brooklyn.

426
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,200
434 Wallace Place.

427
01:14:03,171 --> 01:14:07,172
- They know you're coming.
- Of course. But it won't matter.

428
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,795
Will you stop playing
the fucking video game?

429
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:18,480
Will you stop playing
that fucking video game?

430
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,224
Get down, get down!

431
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:43,169
Come on, come on! Get down, get down!

432
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,016
Make the arrangements.

433
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,369
Thank you.

434
01:17:23,906 --> 01:17:25,938
Our pleasure, sir.

435
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:32,148
A parting gift. From the management.

436
01:17:32,448 --> 01:17:35,748
Compensation for last
night's unfortunate...

437
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,584
incident.

438
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,903
How many times do I
have to save your ass?

439
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:31,006
- I appreciate it.
- Of course.

440
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:34,877
- You look terrible.
- No, I look retired.

441
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:38,578
Retired? You really believe that?

442
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:54,894
You made a new life.

443
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,564
You'll find your way back to it.

444
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,901
It's time to go home.

445
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:59,394
Let's get on with this,
whatever the fuck this is.

446
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:01,427
Hello, Marcus.

447
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:15,241
This is John.

448
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:19,879
I appreciate you granting
my son a swift death.

449
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:25,051
<i>I wouldn't know how
to reply to that either.</i>

450
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:29,689
Marcus betrayed me.

451
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:43,537
- You pulled the contract.
- And while it was open,

452
01:20:43,737 --> 01:20:46,764
you had every chance,

453
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:50,245
every opportunity to kill John Wick.

454
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,348
And if you had done your job,

455
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:55,949
my son would be still alive!

456
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:02,755
And in so doing,
he broke the cardinal rule.

457
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:06,192
Thank you.

458
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:11,407
Ms. Perkins.

459
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,336
Why am I not surprised?

460
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,736
In for a penny, in for a pound.

461
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:21,641
<i>So, John, I had no choice.</i>

462
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,911
I always liked you, Marcus.

463
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:28,448
The last of the old guard.

464
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:41,194
But unlike the others,
you go out on my terms.

465
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:44,730
God! No!

466
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,801
No, my good sir.

467
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,138
I go out on my own.

468
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:14,994
See?

469
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:29,007
Well played, old friend.

470
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:37,185
We done, Viggo?

471
01:22:37,544 --> 01:22:40,653
- We're done.
- Okay. Here.

472
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,812
Thank you.

473
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:47,927
Yeah. Fuel the chopper.

474
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:15,021
<i>Ms. Perkins, I apologize
for calling you at this hour.</i>

475
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:59,635
Ms. Perkins,

476
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:04,298
your membership to the Continental
has been, by thine own hand,

477
01:24:04,398 --> 01:24:06,171
revoked.

478
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,836
<i>I know what you're thinking, Jonathan.</i>

479
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:36,508
<i>We live by a code.</i>

480
01:24:36,608 --> 01:24:38,943
Which is why I'm not the one
telling you that a certain helicopter

481
01:24:39,043 --> 01:24:42,975
at a certain helipad is being
fueled for a certain someone.

482
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,263
- Have you got my cigarettes?
- Yeah, I got your cigarettes.

483
01:25:28,023 --> 01:25:29,222
Oh, fuck!

484
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,220
Yeah. Super. Come on, let's go. Faster!
The helicopter's right down there.

485
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,395
Come on! Let's go!

486
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:50,712
Shit!

487
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,179
Goddamn, I knew he'd come.

488
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:08,697
What's fuckin' wrong with this guy?

489
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:11,297
Somebody give me a gun. Who's got a gun?

490
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:14,919
Oh, God!

491
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:19,439
- That was a good one.
- Who's got a gun?

492
01:26:36,098 --> 01:26:36,873
Fuck!

493
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:56,442
Viggo, the helicopters, right over there.
We have to get over there.

494
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:15,161
Oh, my God, I need a gun.

495
01:27:37,519 --> 01:27:39,919
- English, please.
- Good luck.

496
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:42,538
Russian cocksucker.

497
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:46,391
Fuck!

498
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:12,207
No!

499
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,217
No more guns, John.

500
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:22,321
No more bullets.

501
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:24,957
No more bullets.

502
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:34,900
Just you and me, John.

503
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:36,802
You and me.

504
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:02,764
What happened, John?

505
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:05,533
We were professionals. Civilized.

506
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,700
Do I look civilized to you?

507
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:32,718
Be seeing you, John.

508
01:31:34,855 --> 01:31:36,521
Yeah.

509
01:31:37,124 --> 01:31:39,191
Be seeing you.

510
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:31,571
<i>Come on, John.</i>

511
01:32:31,871 --> 01:32:33,681
<i>Let's go home.</i>

512
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:19,318
It's okay.

513
01:34:20,057 --> 01:34:21,320
Let's go home.
