1
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,958
[FBI Agent 1] Okay. Tape ID number 703.

2
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,750
Time of day, 6:14 a.m.

3
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,583
Interview with informant resumes.

4
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,125
Please restate the names of these two men.

5
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:14,375
[informant] Hector Álvarez. Adrian Lovell.

6
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,583
- You introduced them?
- [informant] Yes.

7
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,625
You brokered an arms deal between them?

8
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,416
[informant] Yes.

9
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,750
And you were in a relationship
with both of them?

10
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,125
[Informant] Yes.

11
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,166
[FBI Agent 1] All right. Okay.

12
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,375
Help me get the food chain right.

13
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,333
Hector Álvarez was supplying Adrian Lovell
with weapons.

14
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:37,708
What kind of weapons?

15
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,500
[informant] This place isn't secure.

16
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:45,500
Lady, stop telling us our jobs.
We can take you in if you want.

17
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,916
- You don't know how bad this gets.
- [FBI Agent 1] Then tell us.

18
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,000
Here.

19
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,250
Look, I get that this is dark,

20
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,291
so why don't we start
with the weapons Álvarez is supplying?

21
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,791
Soviet PKM machine guns,

22
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,791
LAWS rocket launchers,

23
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,541
M18 claymore mines.

24
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,583
It's not the point.

25
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,916
[FBI Agent 1] Actually, it is.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,125
They want you dead
for what you know, right?

27
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,208
We need to talk about my deal.

28
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,916
I'm sick of the bridge tournament
this bitch is playing.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,208
If you need our protection...

30
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,750
You wouldn't know
the first thing about protecting me.

31
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,875
Hey. You're safe here.

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,708
No, I'm not.

33
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,333
[FBI Agent 2] Álvarez is in Cuba,
Lovell's under surveillance.

34
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,208
We've had a tail on him
since the second he landed at O'Hare.

35
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,041
- Then he knows where we are.
- [chuckles softly] Let me tell you...

36
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,625
You think you're following him?
He's following you.

37
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,308
If you think you're gonna dictate
how we conduct an interrogation,

38
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,416
- I don't know who you...
- [silenced gunshot]

39
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,208
[silenced gunshots]

40
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,041
- [grunts]
- [body thuds]

41
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,625
Agents down, shooter outside.

42
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,583
<i>Hawthorne? Carter? Do you copy?</i>

43
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,500
<i>Are we breached? Do you copy?</i>

44
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:18,833
[mouthing] Come.

45
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,333
[silenced gunshot]

46
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,256
- Not the window, don't...
- [silenced gunshot]

47
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,625
[grunts]

48
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,625
- No, let me get...
- Shh!

49
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,291
[FBI Agent 1] Am I gonna die?

50
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,458
I don't know.

51
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,958
[FBI Agent 1 groaning softly]

52
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,500
[coughs]

53
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,166
[glass shatters in distance]

54
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,041
I know you're in there.

55
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,000
Did you think you could hide from me?

56
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,000
You must have known I'd find you.

57
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,500
[groans]

58
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,083
[breathes deeply]

59
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,458
Adrian.

60
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,291
[screams]

61
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,541
[gasps]

[whimpering]

63
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,916
No.

64
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,625
[whimpers]

65
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,083

[exclaims]

68
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,583
[nurse] It's a girl.

69
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,750
[baby crying]

70
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,000
[Mother] Is she okay?

71
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,166
[nurse] She's perfect.

72
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,500
[exhales deeply]

73
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,625
Gimme the room.

74
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,791
Special Agent Williams.

75
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:24,875
How are you?

76
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,916
- Where's my baby?
- She's in the nursery.

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,458
She was very fortunate.

78
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,916
I wanna see her.

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,666
Well, what you want is no longer
the deciding factor in what happens next.

80
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,416
You wasted 12 hours of FBI time
trying to cut a deal for yourself

81
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,125
and seven agents were killed.

82
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,250
This conversation now takes place
on our terms.

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,291
You can't keep her from me.
I'm her mother.

84
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,791
What you are to that child right now
is a death sentence.

85
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:55,041
Adrian Lovell and Hector Álvarez
represent ruthless business interests.

86
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,625
If you leave here with that child,
they will kill her.

87
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,958
Lovell already stabbed a pregnant belly.

88
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,625
What would he do to a live child?

89
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,166
Adrian Lovell is dead.

90
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,291
Lovell was extracted from the house fire
before backup arrived.

91
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,333
His body was never accounted for. [sighs]

92
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,083
Your daughter will be placed
in witness security...

93
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,125
My daughter is <i>not</i>
going into the foster system.

94
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,041
...so no one knows who her mother is.

95
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,208
You underestimate my ability
to protect my child.

96
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,458
Yeah, well, I'm aware.

97
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,083
Back-to-back tours
in Iraq and Afghanistan,

98
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:33,916
46 confirmed kills,
accurate to 1,300 meters with an M24.

99
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,291
Tell me how that helps her.

100
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:43,166
You and I both know the only way
you protect that child is to disappear.

101
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,416
[voice breaking] And if I don't?

102
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,833
They'll find you. Both of you.

103
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,916
[knock at door]

104
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,500
And just so you know,

105
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,958
the FBI has a terrible record
of protecting the whereabouts of people

106
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,958
who caused the death of federal agents.

107
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:14,958
[scoffs]

108
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:23,083

[pen clatters]

110
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,291
- Let her in.
- [man] You sure?

111
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,375
She's good.

112
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,666
Hey.

113
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,750
They just told me.

114
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,208
You all right?

115
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,708
Three things.

116
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,958
One, you put her with good people.

117
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,416
I want her to have the most boring,
stable life there is.

118
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,541
It's a girl?

119
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,791
Two, you let me know she's safe,

120
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,916
every birthday.

121
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,250
Three,

122
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,000
if there's trouble...

123
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
you let me know.

124
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,166
I owe you that.

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,791
[baby crying]

126
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,416
[man] Is she yours?

127
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,250
No.

128
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,041
[switch clicks]

129
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,500
Don't sneak up on somebody with PTS...

130
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:54,166
Well, now I'm really fucking triggered.

131
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,333
[man] You'll need a job.

132
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,875
Some of the ranchers would pay good money
for shooters like you.

133
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,041
Get rid of the wolves.

134
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,958
I don't wanna shoot wolves.

135
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,583
You found God or something?

136
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,541
No.

138
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,375
It's good. Thanks.

- If you want...
- I don't want anything, Jons.

140
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,250
Hey. We're all lost when we get out.

141
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,666
I got more than lost.

142
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,541
Whatever you've done, you're still here.

143
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,833
Still time to make it right.

144
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,958
Anybody sees us in town,
you don't know me.

145
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,333
It's that bad?

Another birthday.

155
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,333
Let's see how big she got.

156
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,541
It's not her birthday.

[Mother] <i>She's in trouble?</i>

00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,458
We gonna say hello first?

160
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,541
Hello.

161
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,166
Civilization is built
on the little things.

162
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,625
Tell me what's going on, Cruise.

163
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:33,708
ATF busted some of Hector Álvarez's men
at a stash house in Nuevo Laredo.

164
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,750
Typical stuff. MK12s,
you know, bump stocks, silencers.

165
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,208
