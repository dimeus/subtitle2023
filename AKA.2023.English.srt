[Soleil] <i>Yeah.</i>

164
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,200
- Okay, I'll be there.
- [dog whines]

165
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,600
SURNAME: HAMON

166
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,640
[lock clicking]

167
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,720
[kids shouting in distance]

168
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
[doorbell rings]

169
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,600
Mochaccino with cream
and chocolate shavings.

170
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,040
- [door closes]
- Thought you gave up caffeine?

171
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
[Kruger scoffs]

172
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,240
I made herbal tea. You'll like it.

173
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,720
You heard about the Star Hotel?

174
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,080
[Adam] A little. Who's the guy?

175
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,800
Moktar Al Tayeb, a Sudanese warlord.

176
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,200
He was a longtime French ally
until he switched allegiance

177
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,400
about ten years ago.

178
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,280
- He's become radicalized.
- [thuds]

179
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,440
Now, he's in contact
with the Islamic State in Eastern Africa.

180
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,040
We found out he was here.

181
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,000
We busted up one of his operations,
but he got away from us.

182
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,800
We're betting he will strike again soon.

183
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,760
- [siren wailing in distance]
- [spoon clanks]

184
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,880
Since when do you set up
operations in France?

185
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
Since when do you ask questions?

186
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,160
[Adam scoffs]

187
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
[glass thuds]

188
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,760
Good. You understand
who your next target is.

189
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,240
All the details are in here.

190
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,640
It's not going to be easy.

191
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,520
Moktar knows how to lie low.

192
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,320
We've been in Sudan five years
looking for him, and he's a slippery one.

193
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,920
[Kruger] He has a loyal network
throughout Europe.

194
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,440
He recently contacted
one of his old friends,

195
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,560
Victor Pastore.

196
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,160
[Kruger] They were partners
in a drug ring for 15 years.

197
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
They became very close.

198
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,880
Victor is his daughter's godfather.

199
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,040
[Kruger] We know he's helping him hide.

200
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,400
You'll infiltrate Pastore's clan.

201
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,240
I want you to get close to Victor,
get him to trust you.

202
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,400
That's how you'll find Al Tayeb.

203
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,360
Victor has a crew of about ten guys,
not really soldiers.

204
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,400
Except for an Albanian former ops guy,
who ensures security.

205
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,320
He's the one you have to take on
if you want to get noticed.

206
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,240
That's the last guy who tried
to infiltrate his crew. Be careful.

207
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
[Kruger] Everything else is in the file.

208
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,400
I just want to point him out.

209
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,880
One of Victor's right-hand men.
He supplies the hired help.

210
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,000
He's your way in.
After that, it's your call.

211
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,200
Do I get backup?

212
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,360
A small surveillance team.

213
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,000
Just Cisko and Mona to cover you.

214
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,840
Same MO we used in Chad.

215
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,960
What's my cover on this one?
There's nothing here.

216
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
[chuckles]

217
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,400
This is where it gets interesting.

218
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,560
[soft tense music]

219
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,960
You need a foolproof identity
in order to infiltrate rapidly.

220
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,040
Victor will be playing it safe.

221
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,360
[Kruger] Can you think of a better cover?

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,480
Dijon, then jail,

223
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,920
the Legion, a few years in Africa,
and now you've come home.

224
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,360
No need to start it too much.
You know it all by heart.

225
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,120
When you say "infiltrate rapidly"?

226
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Tomorrow.

227
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,960
- Steep it longer next time.
- [glass thuds]

228
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,560
[tense music]

229
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,280
[lock buzzes]

230
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
[gate clanks]

231
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,040
You're on time. Good.

232
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,120
All right, come on.

233
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,320
[Jacques] You stay quiet,
do what we tell you.

234
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,480
So, Karim, you missed us, huh?

235
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
[Karim] For sure.

236
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,599
- You all right?
- Yeah. You?

237
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,840
[Youssef] I'm good. I'm good.

238
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,280
Nobody mentioned a new guy. Who's this?

239
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,400
Adam. Jacques told me to come by,
just in case.

240
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
In case what?

241
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,400
In case I'm short one shit for brains
to take a beating for me?

242
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,640
If it pays well.

243
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,920
[scoffs]
If it pays well.

244
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,040
[approaching footsteps]

245
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,480
Gentlemen. Weapons, phones, photo ID.

246
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,480
You fill out this information sheet.

247
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,840
[Youssef] Address,
cell phone number, shoe size,

248
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,080
clothes size, and your blood type.

249
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,800
When it comes to that last one,
don't write anything stupid.

250
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,920
[engine revs in distance]

251
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Karim, you good?
Nothing's changed since winter?

252
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,880
- [Karim] No, all good.
- Glad to hear it.

253
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,936
Writing's not really your things.
[Youssef snickers]

254
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,240
[dog barking in distance]

255
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,560
I'm gonna see Vic.

256
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,240
Come on, this way. You'll meet the team.

257
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,880
[Youssef] All good, Hélène?
Don't you have school?

258
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,280
No, I have a four-hour break,
so I'll just study here.

259
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,136
[Youssef] These are the new guys.
Karim and...

260
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,280
What's your name again?

261
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Adam.

262
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,040
All right, guys, around here,
the rules are simple.

263
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,720
Do what we tell you when we tell you.

264
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,560
You get your paycheck,
and everybody's happy.

265
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,560
[Youssef] Keep in mind,
Victor hates suck-ups.

266
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,200
And watch yourselves,
people have short fuses around here.

267
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,320
[Jonathan] Hey, Uncle Youss! Uncle Youss!

268
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,760
Look what I can do.

269
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,080
- Joe, damn it! You did it again!
- [Jonathan] Did you see?

270
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,360
I'm trying to rest here!

271
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,880
[Natalya] Get out of the pool!

272
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,520
Karim, you remember Manu?

273
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,120
He takes care of making
the neighborhood rounds now.

274
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,200
You'll be with him.
Adam, you'll stay here for the time being.

275
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
[hip-hop music playing]

276
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,160
Hey, dickheads, Adam. Adam, the dickheads.

277
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,576
Hey, guys, it's 10 after 2:00.
Time to get your asses in gear, isn't it?

278
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,480
Yep.

279
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,376
[Youssef] JB, you should be on the roof.
Why aren't you?

280
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,360
Oh, no, Youss, today, there's no way.
I threw my back out again last night.

281
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,720
- [JB] I can't.
- [men chuckle]

282
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,000
What? I'm not kidding. I can barely move.
Ask Pee Wee, I can't even tie my shoes.

283
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,160
Manu, take the new guy,
go to the job site.

284
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,656
- Come on, I just washed my jeans.
- [Youssef] I don't wanna hear it.

285
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,880
JB, Karim, you two come with me,
we gotta meet someone in the 13th.

286
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,040
Meet me at the car in 15 minutes.

287
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,480
[Manu] You lazy little bitch.

288
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,320
[JB] No, bro, legit. I can't.
My back really hurts.

289
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,600
- Yeah? So do my balls.
- [chuckles]

290

[paper rustles]

291
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,440
[Victor] That's really
the best he could do?

292
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,880
[accountant] Yes, sir. That's it.

293
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Forty thousand is a very good offer.

294
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
You think so?

295
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,200
[knocks on door]

296
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,160

[sniffles]

298
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,400
- Yeah, come in.
- [door opens]

299
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,680
Yeah, Victor, I was hoping
to leave early today,

300
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,480
because I have my son this weekend.

301
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,336
[Jacques] I wanna take him somewhere
for a few days.

302
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,760
This is really bad timing, Jacq.

303
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,960
[Jacques] I know, I know,

304
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,000
but this year's been really tough
with the divorce and all.

305
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,600
It's important for his morale.

306
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,600
I brought in two more guys for you
while I'm gone.

307
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,600
One is Karim, you know him.

308
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,360
And Adam, you'll like him.

309
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,520
Ten years in the Legion,
just home from Africa, he's a beast.

310
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,280
[sighs]

311
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
And Youssef, what does he think?

312
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
You know Youssef, if you agree, he agrees.

313
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,560
Okay.

314
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,320
Appreciate it.

315
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,240
[accountant] So, the Milord...

316
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,280
[dog barking in distance]

- [car door shuts]
- [engine starts]

318
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,576
[Manu] First, I gotta do the dirty work,
and now this guy gets to take off

319
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,720
in the middle of the day?

320
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,880
I hope he had time to tell you
why you're here.

321
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,200
All he told me was
Victor's worried about his security.

322
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
[Bogdan] Hey!

323
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,400
What'd you mean by that?

324
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,400
Why? Did I strike a nerve?

325
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
[men chuckle]

326
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,440
[man 2] Oh, here we go.

327
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,560
Don't push it.

328
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,840
[chair rasps]

329
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Yeah.

330
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,160
[approaching footsteps]

331
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,040
Because I'm the one in charge
of his security.

332
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,320
That must be why.

333
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,680
[grunting]

334
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,800
- [dog barking]
- [Manu] Whoa!

335
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,360
What the hell is wrong with you?

336
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Do you want to get killed
on your first day, huh?

337
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,800
- [Victor] Hey!
- [dog whimpers]

338
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
[tense music]

339
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,160
Where do you think you are?

340
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,120
- [Adam] I apologize, Mr. Pastore.
- This is my house.

341
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
- [Victor grunts]
- [Adam groans]

342
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,400
This isn't the jungle. Understood?

343
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
[inhales sharply]

344
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
[coughs]

345
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,920
Now, go shake it off.
Come back when you've calmed down.

346
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,120
Sorry, Vic, I was supposed to go
with Bogdan, what do I do now?

347
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,376
Just take him with you instead.

348
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,320
You can get him up to speed on Amet.

349
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,240
And get Bogdan into the house.

350
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,080
[Victor sighs]
You've gotta be shitting me.

351
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,560
[lock clanking]

352
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,160
I did everything you asked me to.

353
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,920
You okay?

354
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
[tense music]

355
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,640
- [groans]
- [Jacques' son] Dad!

356
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
[hip-hop music playing]

357
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,120
[volume lowers down]

358
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,800
Fill me in on Amet.

359
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
He's a pain in the ass from Aulnay.

360
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,360
He thinks he's a big deal,

361
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,360
because he's got Chechen blood
and the big squad.

362
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,520
He overstepped.

363
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,240
He's been playing on our turf
for six months, but Vic's had enough.

364
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,240
Two weeks ago, there was an incident,
and they lit up the neighborhood.

365
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,640
Yeah, I saw a car earlier.

366
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,800
They'll shoot people in the back
and not give a shit.

367
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,840
The bastards are equipped up the ass.

368
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Good to know.

369
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,960
Where are we headed now?

370
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,200
We're going to see the banker.

371
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,920
[doorbell buzzes]

372
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
[lock blares]

373
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,240
[banker] Don't touch my cut, okay?

374
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Have him send his guys over.
I don't give a shit.

375
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,440
Right. It's always the same with you.

376
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,280
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Whatever.

377
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,280
Yeah, you too. Bye.

378
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,360
Pee Wee.

379
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,840
Good to see you. Have a seat.

380
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,840
You want water? Coffee? Herbal tea?
You seem a little tensed.

381
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Mm-mm.

382
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,960
[Pee Wee] Give me the plans,
and we're out of here.

383
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Uh, okay.

384
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,360
There's just been a little delay
with the plans, but no worries.

385
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,480
What delay?

386
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,040
Yesterday, you told me we're good to go.

387
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,000
"Yesterday." But, uh, since then,
something's come up, nothing major.

388
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,480
In five days, I'll have you in
on something even better.

389
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,080
Golden. For the same price, too.
Victor will love it, I'm telling you.

390
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,640
No, no, no, you don't get it.

391
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,360
I came over here
to get the plans for tomorrow.

392
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,480
And I'm leaving here
with the plans for tomorrow.

393
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,400
You're the one who doesn't get it.

394
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,920
There's no more plans.

395
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,440
Yeah? Okay.

396
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,160
[cocks gun]

397
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,440
And now, still no plans?

398
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,200
[banker] Seriously?
You're pulling a gun on me?

399
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,160
What's the problem?

400
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Okay, Pee Wee,
I'll tell you what's the problem.

401
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,800
I owe these guys one fucking huge debt.

402
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,440
I had to give them the scoop.

403
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,600
[exhales deeply]

404
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,760
These things happen.

405
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,960
Your fucking debt is not my problem.

406
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,440
Size matters, wouldn't you say,
asshole, huh?

407
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,400
I'm not leaving without those plans,
I told you.

408
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,960
Then you won't be leaving at all.

409
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,160
[banker] What are you
going to do, huh? Huh?

410
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,480
- [gunshots]
- [stones thud]

411
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,016
- Son of a bitch! You're breaking my arm!
- Where are the plans?

412
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,920
- No, that's the wrist.
- [bone cracks]

413
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,200
[screams]
Bastard! You broke my wrist!

414
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,400
- Where are the plans?
- In there, in the drawer. Let me go!

415
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,680
[banker groaning]

416
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,120
[groaning continues]
They're right here.

417
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,360
So there you go.

418
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,560
- Not so complicated, was it?
- [banker groans]

419
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,136
All you need to do now
is call your buddies,

420
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,656
and tell them in five days, it's all good.

421
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,320
[banker] Yeah, that's what I'll do.

422
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,840
Fuck.

[mouse clicking]

428
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,160
[Mona] Several stints in prison
for fencing, accomplice to robbery,

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,400
and organized theft.

430
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,640
He's a small player.
No ties with Moktar or the other cells.

431
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,040
Okay, let's forget him.

Hello, Yacine.

I'm sorry for your loss.

464
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,200
We started the process as you told us.
But there's a lot of stuff to transport.

465
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,160
The Egyptian accepted to work with us.

466
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,880
Now, he wants money.

467

But I vouched for you.

468
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,040
He said he can wait for the payment.

469
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,520
Thank you. You're truly a brother.

470
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,920
No joke, man, you ruptured my eardrum
with that crazy move back there.

[Pee Wee] So, this is Adam.

- How are you doing, Michelle?

00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,440
- I thought you'd be bigger.
- Oh, relax, he's cool.

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,160
Bogdan kinda asked for it.

- [Pee Wee] You good, Mimi?
- [Mimi] Yeah, honey, you?

478
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,680
- [Pee Wee] Same.
- [Mini] Great.

479
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,840
You guys have a good night.

480
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,640
- Thanks, you too.
- [Stacy] Hey. Hi, Pee Wee.

481
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,160
[Pee Wee] Hey, Stacy, how's it going?
Camel, can I get two scotch?

482
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,520
- [woman 1] Come on, girls. Get moving.
- [women laughing]

483
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,816
- [woman 2] Twenty minutes.
- Could you help me with my costume?

484
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,880
Bottom's up to your special skills.
[laughs]

485
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,240
[woman 2] Come on. Let's go, please!

486
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,040
Again.
[breathes deeply]

487
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,200
[clicks tongue]
It's good vibe, huh?

488
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,120
[Pee Wee] Tonight, we relax
and have a good time.

489
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
[upbeat music playing]

490
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,240
Hey, forget about Victor earlier.

491
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,520
He's a little stressed out these days.
He can't help it.

492
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,120
Because of Amet or something else?

493
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,320
Amet's not helping,
but there's other stuff.

494
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,120
[JB] Hey, Pee Wee! What's up?

495
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,136
- Hey, man, it's good to see you. Yeah.
- All good?

496
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,800
[woman 3] ...for Stacy, who'll be back
on the pole in half an hour.

497
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,280
[crowd cheering]

498
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,480
[Natalya] Sara, I need you to entertain
some real customers.

499
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,720
If you don't mind.

500
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,400
- Everything okay, gentlemen?
- Perfect.

501
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
[slow music playing]

502
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,680
Sorry, darling, you need
to get yourself ready.

503
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,400
Your dick goes anywhere but there.

504
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,320
Private property. Not one finger on her.

505
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,480
I'll get us another one.

506
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,280
[people chattering, laughing]

507
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,240

[laughter]

512
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,800
- [man 1] I'm telling you...
- [man 2] Hello, ladies.

513
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
- [man 3] Yeah!
- [overlapping chatter]

514
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,280
Can't let you in tonight, guys.

515
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,960
You serious?
We're not here to stir shit up.

516
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,520
We just wanna fuck the pretty girls.

517
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,440
You're done. Victor doesn't want you here.

518
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,080
What do you want? If it's a tip, say so.

519
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,520
- Huh?
- [men snickering]

520
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,200
- Hey, hey, leave the girls alone.
- Hey, I was talking to you.

521
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,320
- Get lost, I said.
- We're gonna kick your ass!

522
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,680
- Get off!
- [woman 4] Hey!

523
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,240
[Pee Wee] Carlala!

524
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,040
Hey, Amet's guys are beating
the shit out of Sofiane.

525
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,960
Come on, Pee Wee, move!

526
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,240
MILORD

527
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,040

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
[slow music playing]

00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,240
[brake squeaks]

530
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,480
Thanks for protecting us.

531
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
It's my job.

532
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,160
[breathes deeply]

533
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,560
It's just a scratch. I'm fine.

534
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,960
I really need you
to take Jonathan to school.

535
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,360
Normally, it's Sofiane who takes him
when his shift is done.

536
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,200
- Okay.
- Do you have a car?

537
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,960
Yeah, it's just out front.

538
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,360
You're an angel. Take this.

539
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,520
Keep the pressure on.

540
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,200
[Hélène] There are white muscles,
which are smooth,

541
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,720
and there are red muscles,
which are striated.

542
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,440
Red muscles are types of muscles

543
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,880
that depend on the, uh...

544
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,520
- Central...
- Central nervous system.

545
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,520
And the white muscles depend
on the autonomic nervous system.

546
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,440
- The autonomic nervous system controls...
- I got the files you wanted.

547
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,720
[Hélène] Oh, for Christ's sake.

548
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,496
Oh, and there was a shit show
outside the Milord.

549
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,800
Oh, yeah?

550
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,320
[Youssef] Soso took a beating
from some of Amet's guys.

551
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,720
Janusz and his gang. He's at the hospital.

552
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,240
He fell and cracked his skull pretty good,
broke a few teeth and fractured his jaw.

553
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,376
I suppose this is after he told them
they're not welcome.

554
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,120
[Victor] We need to put them
in their place.

555
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,360
[Youssef] If you want.

556
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,400
But the guys took care of it already.
Don't worry.

557
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,080
[Victor] Took care of it, how?

558
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,320
The new guy, Adam.

559
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,960
He demolished them.

560
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,000
I haven't seen the footage,

561
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,280
but apparently,
the guy can hit like Tyson Fury.

562
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
[door closes]

563
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,440
Ooh!

564
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,520
[loud footsteps]

565
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,896
[Natalya] What do you want me
to do about it?

566
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,719
His guys were spending money on my girls

567
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,880
long before you got
into this pissing contest!

568
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,920
[Victor] Pissing contest?
They shot at us last month.

569
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,135
[Natalya] They weren't involved in that.

570
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,800
[Victor] It's the same guys,
in the same gang. They work for Amet.

571
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,719
I don't wanna see a single one
of those assholes on my property.

572
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,776
- Do you hear me?
- [Natalya] But Janusz and his guys,

573
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,615
they don't give a shit
about your stupid games!

574
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:00,056
But what I give a shit about
is they spend five grand a night!

575
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,800
[Victor] Five thousand is what's
gonna cost to fix Sofiane's teeth!

576
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,760
You always say business comes first.

577
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,040
[Natalya] And now you're telling your guys
to refuse clients behind my back, too?

578
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,920
Stop thinking with your goddamn balls
and start using your brain!

579
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,816
Do I need to tell you
how much you need cash now?

580
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,080
Hey, don't you start with that!

581
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,240
What do you want, boy?

582
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,080
You're almost eight, Jonathan.
You're too old for kisses now.

583
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Go on.

584
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,640
- [Victor] Did you test the new guy?
- [Natalya] Yes.

585
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,120
Come here, sweetheart. Don't be sad.

586
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,120
- And?
- Sofiane doesn't feel good today.

587
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,200
So you'll go to school with someone new.
His name's Adam, he's very nice.

588
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
- And?
- He knows how to behave!

589
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,600
[Natalya] I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed.

590
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,776
- [Victor] I'm not finished.
- [Natalya] Well, I am!

591
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,336
[Victor] Watch your tone
when you're talking to me!

592
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,336
[Natalya] You can pretend
you're Escobar all you want,

593
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,640
but I'm not your bitch.

594
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,400
Without my girls, you have zero cash flow.

595
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,560
[birds chirping]

596
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,440
[gloomy music]

597
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,880
I think you need boxing lessons.

598
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,960
[Adam sighs]
Let's go.

599
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,600
My sister said it's only losers
who'd get in fights.

600
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,560
But I don't totally agree.

601
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,720
There's a few kids at school
who would shut up if I knew how to fight.

602
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,840
Sure.

603
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,560
Anyway, are you coming
to my birthday tomorrow?

604
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,440
[Jonathan] Everyone's coming over.
It's gonna be super fun!

605
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,720
You can even play Wii with us
if you want, Wii is my favorite.

606
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,040
- I like PS4.
- [engine starts]

607
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,160
Yeah, but you can't play Mario
on PS4 or Zelda.

608
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,680
Even if it's kinda hard,
'cause it's confusing.

609
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,776
But the best is Mario Kart.

610
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,360
You could have lots of players.

611
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
[gasps]

612
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,400
Seriously?

613
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,560
[sighs]

614
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
[engine stops]

615
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,240
So where's Sofiane?

616
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,320
At the hospital.

617
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,376
Joe, I'll take you to school. Come on.

618
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,680
But we were talking.

619
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,200
- Natalya asked me...
- Natalya's judgement is off these days.

620
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,376
- [Hélène] Come on. Let's go.
- [Jonathan] I forgot your name!

621
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,080
- Adam.
- See you at my party, then, Adam.

622
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,320
- [Hélène] Oh, you're getting so big.
- [Jonathan] Bye!

623
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
[door slams]

[chimes]

627
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,640
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

628
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,560
TIME FOR LEVEL 2.

629
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,880
YOU'LL GET BUGS AND GPS TRACKERS.
DO YOUR THING!

630
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040

Please, have a seat.

First, I want to say thank you
for last night at the club.

649
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,920
You really stood up for us,
the guys told me.

650
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,880
That's what you pay me for.

651
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,080
I'm glad you brought that up.

652
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,720
Yesterday, you worked for free.

653
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,560
And today,
you're gonna work for free also.

654
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,560
Because I had to pay
for all of Bogdan's expenses

655
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,160
when you nearly busted his larynx.

656
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,800
So let's get one thing clear.

657
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,840
You don't ever lift a finger
against your brothers

How many bullets did you take?

- Five.
- Five. In close range.

668
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,520
That has to leave a few scars, no?

No?

Welcome to the family.

Do you miss being in Africa?

678
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,800
- No, I've seen enough.
- Where were you?

679
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,160
Moved around a lot. DRC, Mali, Tunisia.

680
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,240
- And a bit of Sudan.
- Sudan? Huh, I know it well.

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,240
It was beautiful before the war.

I can help you with that.

691
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,320
Bogdan is in charge of my security.

692
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,520
Mm.

693
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,440
You've been here one day.

694
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,080
So for now, you'll take over for Sofiane.

695
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,960
At least tonight, because I'm sure
he can barely stand up right now.

696
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,960
Which also means you need
to pick up Jonathan at school later.

697
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,880
He's out at four. And he has Judo.
His bag is in his room.

698
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,720
His sister pulled him
out of my car earlier.

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,040
It would probably piss her off.

Look, my daughter is a royal pain
in the ass, like my wife.

I'm not looking to get that kid

I need a bodyguard.

Okay.

704
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,200
Good. Now get some rest.

I hope you do the same.

What would you do if you were me?

Same as you.

in one thing.

our land, and our resources.

And you invite me under diplomatic cover

1514
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:40,080
You even took her from me.

1515
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,240
Her operation was a success.

1516
