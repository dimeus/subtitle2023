1
00:01:00,732 --> 00:01:04,171
"I am the way
into the city of woe.

2
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,716
"I am the way into eternal pain.

3
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,292
"I am the way
to go among the lost.

4
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:21,897
"Before me, there were
no created things.

5
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:25,357
"But those that last forever.

6
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:30,836
"As do I!

7
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,301
"Abandon all hope you
who are about to enter here."

8
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:42,242
You are now in the presence

9
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,707
of the motherfuckin' king!

10
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,465
You ready, John?

11
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:14,901
Yeah.

12
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,582
Move! John Wick!

13
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,432
Mr. Wick.

14
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,337
To what do I owe the pleasure?

15
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:32,379
My ring.

16
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,481
My freedom.

17
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:40,129
Your ring is gone,

18
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:41,949
like The Elder before me.

19
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,167
And if you came here thinking

20
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:47,266
you could end this
by killing me,

21
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,055
then you are mistaken.

22
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:51,968
My death will not
change the outcome

23
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,995
any more than you can
change your nature.

24
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,445
None of us
can escape who we are,

25
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:02,343
and no one escapes The Table.

26
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,552
And the only way John Wick

27
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:09,383
will ever have freedom
or peace, now or ever,

28
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:11,748
is in death.

29
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,587
I know.

30
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:22,022
I'm afraid you've come
a very long way

31
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:23,925
for nothing.

32
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:27,434
Yeah...

33
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,099
Not really.

34
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:25,822
The Manager, please.

35
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:38,967
A Harbinger is here
to see you, sir.

36
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,878
This must be a mistake.

37
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,745
There is no mistake.

38
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,320
By order of the Marquis,

39
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,818
Vincent Bisset de Gramont,

40
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,912
this hotel has been condemned.

41
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,992
You have one hour.

42
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:17,203
He is expecting you.

43
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:24,956
Can they do this, sir?

44
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,214
The decree is signed
by the 12 members of The Table,

45
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:31,366
giving the Marquis

46
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,161
the power of <i>autem imperator,</i>

47
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:38,026
which means he is
now our judge, jury and...

48
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:42,767
Evacuate the hotel.

49
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,332
Ned Kelly's final words
as the hangman slipped

50
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:05,526
the noose
around his neck were...

51
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,497
"Such is life."

52
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:12,705
Can you imagine the
acceptance, the defiance?

53
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:15,536
Today is not the day
you will die.

54
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:18,078
Of that, I am sure.

55
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:21,513
You have the unshakeable
faith of David, my friend,

56
00:08:21,537 --> 00:08:23,610
but you shouldn't be here.

57
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:26,173
This will not be pleasant.

58
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:29,781
Such is life, sir.

59
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:59,745
My father used to say,

60
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,555
"How you do anything

61
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:05,695
"is how you do everything."

62
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:09,051
Called it the first
and the last rule of life.

63
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,320
You believe in rules...

64
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:19,028
Mr. Manager?

65
00:09:21,135 --> 00:09:22,163
Oh, I do.

66
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,804
And what of consequences?

67
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,807
Of course.

68
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,289
And second chances.

69
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:37,125
Ah. That's where we differ,

70
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,282
you and I.

71
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,629
Second chances

72
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:46,957
are the refuge of men who fail.

73
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:18,659
Mm.

74
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,091
There are those on The Table

75
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,603
who blame this, um,

76
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:27,228
atrocity on New York.

77
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,836
They believe it's this city.

78
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,417
The Table has indulged this

79
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:37,073
fucking place for too long.

80
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,142
And look where
that has gotten us.

81
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:45,361
I shot him.

82
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:47,754
And yet he lives,

83
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,392
polluting everything he touches.

84
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,235
Marquis, respectfully,
my hotel...

85
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,893
Your hotel?

86
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,832
If I might, sir?

87
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:09,006
By all means.

88
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:14,913
The Continentals
and their management

89
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:17,659
are a reminder

90
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:19,629
to all who sit beneath The Table

91
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:23,020
that none of us
are above the rules.

92
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:27,222
And yet we are here.

93
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:29,199
Sir, Mr. Wick...

94
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,765
We're not here
because of John Wick!

95
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:39,399
He is simply the face
of your failure, Mr. Manager.

96
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:46,019
The sand in that glass

97
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:50,245
is merely an echo
of my remaining patience.

98
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:22,178
You are no longer New York.

99
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:26,952
You are nothing.

100
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,418
You are Excommunicado.

101
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:34,553
And as such...

102
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:40,493
you no longer need the
services of a concierge.

103
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,423
It has been an honor,

104
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:11,925
my friend.

105
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:23,140
It should have been me.

106
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,308
Yes.

107
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:28,607
But it wasn't.

108
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:31,425
Now, you think about
why that is,

109
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:35,119
and perhaps one of us will have
benefited from this conversation.

110
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,610
I have a name for you.

111
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:12,953
Respectfully,

112
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,054
I'm retired.

113
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:17,188
Finished. Done.

114
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,191
I disagree.

115
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,655
I'm no use to you.

116
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:25,975
Or The Table.

117
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:29,468
That's not for you to decide.

118
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:37,472
I think you should
find someone else.

119
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,511
You came close.

120
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:46,217
Today.

121
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:48,223
Too close.

122
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,188
You put her in danger.

123
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:04,565
I know the deal I made.

124
00:16:16,444 --> 00:16:19,085
A former associate, I believe.

125
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,321
He was.

126
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:29,260
And a friend.

127
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:33,433
Hmm.

128
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:39,105
The agreement with
The Table stays the same.

129
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:41,979
We give you a name,

130
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:43,340
you give us a life.

131
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:44,808
Or...

132
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,278
we take one.

133
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:09,465
I will serve.

134
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,303
I will be of service.

135
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:17,242
Excellent!

136
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:24,579
I assume you have a
notion of where he might be?

137
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,454
John Wick has few friends
remaining in the world,

138
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:34,259
and even fewer he trusts

139
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:36,294
with his life.

140
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:42,133
Very, very good.

141
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:35,259
Welcome to the Osaka
Continental. How can I help?

142
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:36,717
Yeah, I'm lookin' for a room.

143
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,328
I'm afraid this facility
doesn't allow animals.

144
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:46,637
Emotional support animal.

145
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:48,570
She's your support
animal? Other way round.

146
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,567
I'm hers.
Isn't that right?

147
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:58,376
She stays in your room.

148
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:03,612
Enjoy your stay, sir.

149
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:14,557
It's not too bad.

150
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,994
Not bad at all.

151
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:33,580
There is a dog in my lobby.

152
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:35,184
Emotional support animal.

153
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,257
Of course it is.

154
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:39,757
Tomorrow's schedule.
Mr. Suzuki at 11:00

155
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:42,357
and the Tarasovs are
requesting an audience at 2:00.

156
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,263
What's this at 8:00?

157
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:45,562
Dinner with your daughter.

158
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:46,734
She says she's
concerned you've been

159
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,294
working too hard.

160
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,235
What must I have done to deserve

161
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,703
such a considerate child?

162
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,042
Good karma,
I suppose. Indeed.

163
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,645
And how are our guests?

164
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:03,148
Some of our gold club
members are anxious.

165
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:05,185
It's always something.

166
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,151
And today it's New York.

167
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:08,657
And my concierge?

168
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:10,659
Concerned.

169
00:20:10,683 --> 00:20:14,254
Perhaps we should get you
an emotional support animal.

170
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,067
We've done nothing
to offend The Table.

171
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,965
Your relationship with Mr. Wick
is no secret.

172
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:28,003
The Table will come.

173
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,995
And...

174
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:33,982
...will be met with our grace.

175
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:35,638
Everything he touches dies.

176
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:46,517
Forgive me, Father.

177
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:52,325
Akira.

178
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,303
Please tell my daughter

179
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:59,365
that I look forward
to our dinner.

180
00:22:03,593 --> 00:22:05,464
Apparently not.

181
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:09,501
Killing the Elder
was a mistake, my friend.

182
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:17,003
Their response was the destruction
of the New York Continental.

183
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,974
My daughter fears we are next.

184
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:23,522
Winston?

185
00:22:23,546 --> 00:22:27,145
Alive, but they executed
his concierge

186
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:29,917
to prove a point.

187
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:44,437
Have you given any thought to

188
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:46,505
where this ends?

189
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,875
The Table will never stop.

190
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:56,917
You know this.

191
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:02,818
It only takes life

192
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,788
and only gives death.

193
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,059
Koji...

194
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:26,171
Friendship means little
when it's convenient.

195
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,973
Welcome to the Osaka
Continental. How can I help?

196
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:20,159
The manager.

197
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:23,965
<i>Por favor.</i>

198
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,109
Of course.

199
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,840
Please, make
yourself comfortable.

200
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:44,623
The only path
this leads to is death.

201
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:50,099
I'm going to kill them all.

202
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:52,994
I believe you'll try.

203
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,003
But no one,

204
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,834
not even you, can kill everyone.

205
00:25:00,602 --> 00:25:01,838
You want to die?

206
00:25:02,704 --> 00:25:04,005
That's your choice.

207
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:06,777
A good death

208
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:10,143
only comes after a good life.

209
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:13,623
You and I left
a good life behind

210
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,951
a long time ago, my friend.

211
00:25:21,162 --> 00:25:22,925
Father, The High Table.

212
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:25,999
What is he doing here?

213
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:28,161
Mr. Wick is our guest.

214
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:30,537
Father...

215
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:32,975
I'll talk to them. They
don't know you're here.

216
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,806
Stay with Mr. Wick.

217
00:25:48,387 --> 00:25:49,589
<i>Hai.</i>

218
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:18,145
Welcome
to the Osaka Continental, gentlemen.

219
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,057
How may I be of service?

220
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,762
The Table has reason to believe

221
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:27,158
that this facility
is providing services...

222
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,708
That is a grave accusation.

223
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:37,637
We will require full
access to your hotel.

224
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:40,677
Of course.

225
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,380
But as you are well aware,

226
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:44,211
no business,

227
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,916
not even your kind of business,

228
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,524
may be conducted
on Continental grounds.

229
00:26:49,548 --> 00:26:52,052
So, I'm going to have to ask you

230
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:54,687
to surrender your firearms.

231
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:58,531
We speak for the Marquis.

232
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:00,693
And I speak for Osaka.

233
00:27:01,293 --> 00:27:02,321
Your guns,

234
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,125
please.

235
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:09,874
Don't repeat the mistake
that fool in New York made.

236
00:27:09,898 --> 00:27:12,906
Fools talk, cowards are silent,

237
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,715
but wise men listen.

238
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:17,710
So which one will you be?

239
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:30,448
Hello, old friend.

240
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:37,059
So good of you to visit
after all these years.

241
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:40,326
You are with them now? No.

242
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:44,935
No. Your daughter?

243
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:46,937
Mia?

244
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:49,742
Alive.

245
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:52,811
And your daughter Akira?

246
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:55,946
Well.

247
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,883
I'm glad.

248
00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:02,722
You know...

249
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:06,825
we don't have
to end this with blood.

250
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:10,436
Then leave.

251
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,904
No one defies The Table.

252
00:28:11,928 --> 00:28:14,507
I remember once
you understood that.

253
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:16,075
And I remember a time

254
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,980
when you understood
the meaning of brotherhood.

255
00:28:19,004 --> 00:28:20,647
Enough!

256
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:22,650
By order of
the Marquis de Gramont,

257
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:25,173
this hotel has
been deconsecrated.

258
00:28:26,214 --> 00:28:27,439
Step aside.

259
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,962
Don't do this, Koji.

260
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,072
I'm sorry.

261
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:16,614
Get out.

262
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,719
Secure the hotel.

263
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:44,081
Find Wick.

264
00:30:52,288 --> 00:30:53,526
If they find you here,

265
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,522
The Table will
kill my father, me,

266
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,130
everyone, because
you broke the rules.

267
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,133
You shouldn't have come.

268
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:28,625
You armed?

269
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:40,593
<i>Hai.</i>

270
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,663
Hey!

271
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:38,260
Blind man!

272
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:40,356
Do your job!

273
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,775
Akira!

274
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:14,802
Get out the way you came.

275
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,275
Go to the Umeda
Station. I'll stay.

276
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:19,833
Don't insult my gift to you.

277
00:38:22,572 --> 00:38:25,575
And, John, do me
a small courtesy.

278
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,228
John?

279
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:51,802
Caine.

280
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,780
They gave you my name.

281
00:44:06,218 --> 00:44:07,279
Yeah.

282
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:11,921
I'm sorry.

283
00:44:14,258 --> 00:44:15,287
Me, too.

284
00:44:37,112 --> 00:44:38,981
You should have stayed out.

285
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,380
For all our sakes.

286
00:44:43,489 --> 00:44:45,317
I tried.

287
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:48,386
Did you?

288
00:45:22,922 --> 00:45:24,257
Come on, John.

289
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:28,397
Let's get this shit over with.

290
00:45:32,404 --> 00:45:33,913
Yeah.

291
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:36,236
That sounds like a good idea.

292
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,320
You took a deal.

293
00:45:56,594 --> 00:45:57,994
Same as you, John.

294
00:46:01,695 --> 00:46:02,900
Family?

295
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:07,799
Family.

296
00:46:36,963 --> 00:46:38,430
You dead, John?

297
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,007
John.

298
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:19,075
Caine.

299
00:47:57,177 --> 00:48:01,157
John Wick, open...

300
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:05,582
John Wick...

301
00:49:10,883 --> 00:49:12,725
Damn, Johnny.

302
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:15,257
This is quite the
mess you've made.

303
00:49:15,858 --> 00:49:17,602
I don't know you.

304
00:49:17,626 --> 00:49:18,759
But I know you.

305
00:49:26,605 --> 00:49:28,171
You a tracker?

306
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:35,079
How much?

307
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:39,611
Not enough.

308
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,582
But it's gettin' there.

309
00:49:49,594 --> 00:49:52,030
I need you to take better
care of yourself, Johnny.

310
00:49:54,297 --> 00:49:56,232
'Cause we're
in this together now.

311
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:42,245
All right, Koji.

312
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:49,384
Just tell me where John is
and get out of here.

313
00:50:50,787 --> 00:50:51,848
Leave.

314
00:50:52,956 --> 00:50:55,522
Go somewhere far away.

315
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,822
You know I won't.

316
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:29,886
You owe John Wick nothing.

317
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,265
He has no marker on you.

318
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,344
You must have
fallen far to believe

319
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:46,369
the only debts we have...

320
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:49,840
...lie in markers.

321
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,584
Come on.

322
00:52:00,023 --> 00:52:01,654
I don't want to do this.

323
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:49,207
Father!

324
00:53:04,856 --> 00:53:05,949
Look at me.

325
00:53:14,298 --> 00:53:16,696
Even a blind man knows
you have lost.

326
00:53:18,936 --> 00:53:20,370
And, Caine,

327
00:53:21,935 --> 00:53:25,639
you don't need eyes
to see the right path.

328
00:53:29,314 --> 00:53:30,974
Just take care of your daughter.

329
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:34,681
I...

330
00:53:37,753 --> 00:53:38,850
I am.

331
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,463
No!

332
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:25,732
Don't.

333
00:54:28,301 --> 00:54:29,505
Live.

334
00:54:51,557 --> 00:54:53,331
I'll be waiting for you.

335
00:56:06,036 --> 00:56:07,163
Who is he?

336
00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:15,908
He was a friend.

337
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:20,176
My father is dead
because of you.

338
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:25,115
Because of what you did.

339
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:30,956
So either you kill him...

340
00:56:33,129 --> 00:56:34,465
or I will.

341
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:43,441
I understand.

342
00:57:03,556 --> 00:57:06,893
Goodbye, Mr. Wick.

343
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:31,214
Thanks for coming.

344
00:57:32,722 --> 00:57:34,400
Well, us homeless folk
do have to

345
00:57:34,424 --> 00:57:36,494
stick together now, don't we?

346
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,567
I need to speak to him.

347
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:47,874
Last time you spoke to him,

348
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:50,884
you shot him off a roof.

349
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:52,846
I had no choice.

350
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,743
They held all the cards.

351
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,514
No.

352
00:57:57,314 --> 00:57:59,024
But who held the gun?

353
00:57:59,048 --> 00:58:01,656
John needs to know the
breadth of what's coming at him.

354
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,496
This Marquis is unrestrained.

355
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,460
The Table have
let him off the leash.

356
00:58:05,484 --> 00:58:07,695
Oh, my dear Winston,

357
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:10,660
your benevolence is touching!

358
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,439
But tell me.
Tell me true.

359
00:58:14,463 --> 00:58:17,138
Why did the Frenchman
let you live?

360
00:58:17,162 --> 00:58:20,131
Killing a man can
turn him into a martyr.

361
00:58:21,272 --> 00:58:23,847
Letting him live...

362
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:27,204
tells the world he's a
coward or a turncoat.

363
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:32,583
So what are you?

364
00:58:34,547 --> 00:58:36,081
Aggrieved.

365
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:01,214
I fail to see how laying
waste to Continentals

366
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:04,724
is getting you closer
to killing John Wick.

367
00:59:04,748 --> 00:59:08,021
This campaign
is not to kill John Wick.

368
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,984
It is to kill the
idea of John Wick.

369
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:13,795
And to do that, I must

370
00:59:13,819 --> 00:59:16,693
destroy everything
that idea touches.

371
00:59:21,763 --> 00:59:23,670
The bloodshed in Osaka

372
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:25,229
was not necessary.

373
00:59:26,802 --> 00:59:29,871
The bloodshed was the point.

374
00:59:45,687 --> 00:59:47,625
He'll make it your choice.

375
00:59:55,399 --> 00:59:57,261
You, come with me.

376
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,034
Think twice before accepting.

377
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:08,811
And you are?

378
01:00:09,577 --> 01:00:10,813
Nobody.

379
01:00:12,844 --> 01:00:16,558
Coyness, Mr. Nobody,

380
01:00:16,582 --> 01:00:18,282
is a pathetic trait.

381
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,226
A miscalculation,

382
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,634
in which by trying
to hide our ego,

383
01:00:24,658 --> 01:00:26,697
we let it appear stark naked.

384
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,361
I will ask only once.

385
01:00:36,607 --> 01:00:38,808
How were you able to locate him?

386
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:42,372
Pay and I'll tell you.

387
01:00:48,447 --> 01:00:51,496
How much would such
a service be worth?

388
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,961
Twenty-five million,

389
01:00:52,985 --> 01:00:55,827
plus a matching contribution
to my 401k

390
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:57,101
when he's dead.

391
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,289
Hmm.

392
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,506
We found him once.

393
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:03,571
We'll find him again.

394
01:01:03,595 --> 01:01:04,907
Is that before

395
01:01:04,931 --> 01:01:07,100
or after he puts you
in the ground?

396
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,240
I like you.

397
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:20,344
Twenty million.

398
01:01:24,422 --> 01:01:25,822
Like me some more.

399
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:28,319
Twenty-three.

400
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:32,565
Ego, Mr. Nobody. Mm.

401
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:34,672
It's 23.

402
01:01:34,696 --> 01:01:36,459
You clearly can afford it.

403
01:01:44,674 --> 01:01:46,370
For the service.
Mm-hmm.

404
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,507
Fuck!

405
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:55,427
No, no, no.
No. It's okay.

406
01:01:55,451 --> 01:01:57,553
Hey, it's okay.
Sit. Sit.

407
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:02,828
What the fuck is this, man?

408
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:05,098
A choice.

409
01:02:05,122 --> 01:02:06,671
You can pull the knife out

410
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:09,842
or you can pull your hand out.

411
01:02:09,866 --> 01:02:12,772
One shows me a man
committed only to himself,

412
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:14,172
and the other,

413
01:02:14,196 --> 01:02:16,532
a man committed to the cause.

414
01:02:17,706 --> 01:02:18,974
Which one are you?

415
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:55,202
Winston.

416
01:03:55,868 --> 01:03:57,237
Jonathan.

417
01:03:58,971 --> 01:04:00,911
My condolences.

418
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:03,947
He was a good man.

419
01:04:05,912 --> 01:04:07,379
Yes, he was.

420
01:04:08,146 --> 01:04:10,085
Taken for our sins.

421
01:04:20,091 --> 01:04:21,558
Who is this?

422
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:25,208
The Marquis de Gramont.

423
01:04:25,232 --> 01:04:28,907
Elevated only by his
guarantee of killing you.

424
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:32,404
All the resources of The
Table are at his disposal.

425
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,473
Where do I find him?

426
01:04:36,546 --> 01:04:37,574
Paris.

427
01:04:42,586 --> 01:04:43,954
Where will it end?

428
01:04:45,521 --> 01:04:46,521
Huh?

429
01:04:47,954 --> 01:04:49,355
With him dead.

430
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:52,193
Oh. And then?

431
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,068
Hmm?

432
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:59,373
Have you learned nothing?

433
01:04:59,397 --> 01:05:02,877
They will replace him
before the body's cold.

434
01:05:02,901 --> 01:05:04,710
Hercules had his Hydra.

435
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,180
You have The Table,
except you'll run out of bullets

436
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:09,276
before they run out of heads.

437
01:05:13,512 --> 01:05:17,027
Kill him, but do it
the smart way.

438
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:19,187
And get him to give you
your freedom.

439
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:23,199
How?

440
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,838
Turn his rules and
consequences against him.

441
01:05:25,862 --> 01:05:28,394
Challenge him to single combat.

442
01:05:30,065 --> 01:05:33,312
High Table duels are a myth.

443
01:05:33,336 --> 01:05:34,747
Wrong!

444
01:05:34,771 --> 01:05:37,542
They're a cold hard fact,

445
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,778
and part of the foundation
of The Table

446
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:43,409
to stop its more combustible
members from outright war.

447
01:05:45,782 --> 01:05:48,183
It's also, win or lose,

448
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:52,220
what you say you want,

449
01:05:52,886 --> 01:05:54,420
a way out.

450
01:05:58,389 --> 01:06:00,770
I don't sit at The Table.

451
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:03,172
Your family does.

452
01:06:03,196 --> 01:06:04,975
Get them to issue the challenge

453
01:06:04,999 --> 01:06:07,547
and then offer you up as proxy.

454
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:09,881
I don't have a family.

455
01:06:09,905 --> 01:06:12,471
The Ruska Roma tore my ticket.

456
01:06:14,145 --> 01:06:18,081
Then I suggest you
get your ass to Berlin

457
01:06:18,848 --> 01:06:20,281
and get it mended.

458
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,184
Or...

459
01:06:24,688 --> 01:06:25,715
pick a plot.

460
01:06:28,324 --> 01:06:30,720
What do you get
out of this, Winston?

461
01:06:32,097 --> 01:06:34,361
What you were so good
at getting, Jonathan.

462
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:37,162
Revenge.

463
01:07:30,018 --> 01:07:32,419
Hmm.

464
01:08:16,132 --> 01:08:17,563
Nice suit.

465
01:08:33,949 --> 01:08:35,489
Speak.

466
01:08:35,513 --> 01:08:38,395
He's in Berlin,
at the Ruska Roma.

467
01:08:38,419 --> 01:08:40,795
<i>You can wire
that finder's fee now.</i>

468
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:41,884
No.

469
01:08:42,694 --> 01:08:44,169
<i>Excuse me?</i>

470
01:08:44,193 --> 01:08:46,691
Kill John and you'll
get your money.

471
01:08:48,196 --> 01:08:49,925
That wasn't part of our deal.

472
01:08:51,366 --> 01:08:54,775
The deal was for your service.

473
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:58,472
And it's now a life
for a life, Mr. Nobody.

474
01:09:00,273 --> 01:09:03,783
<i>Yours or his.</i>

475
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:07,352
When it's done,
you will have your prize.

476
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,812
And your pension.

477
01:09:18,123 --> 01:09:19,361
Asshole.

478
01:09:51,158 --> 01:09:52,592
Jonathan Wick?

479
01:10:10,012 --> 01:10:11,418
You are forgetting

480
01:10:11,442 --> 01:10:14,422
we are still under The Table.

481
01:10:14,446 --> 01:10:17,125
And last I checked...

482
01:10:17,149 --> 01:10:19,326
...you are Excommunicado

483
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:22,556
and your ticket was torn.

484
01:10:23,788 --> 01:10:27,297
You have no business with us.

485
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:31,763
Pyotr is dead!

486
01:10:36,675 --> 01:10:38,281
After you

487
01:10:38,305 --> 01:10:40,508
put a bullet
in The Elder's head,

488
01:10:42,347 --> 01:10:44,842
the Marquis had one
put in Pyotr's.

489
01:10:45,943 --> 01:10:49,326
And in fine Russian tradition...

490
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:52,047
He sent us the bill.

491
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:55,327
Because of you,

492
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:56,796
I had to kneel

493
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,731
in front of the man
who murdered my father.

494
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,971
Then we have

495
01:11:01,995 --> 01:11:03,663
a common enemy.

496
01:11:05,035 --> 01:11:07,908
We can help each other.

497
01:11:07,932 --> 01:11:12,110
You can't even help yourself.

498
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:14,545
How the hell are
you going to help us?

499
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:18,451
By killing this Marquis.

500
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:20,376
They just appoint another.

501
01:11:24,889 --> 01:11:26,458
It does

502
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:29,491
if I kill him in a duel!

503
01:12:10,499 --> 01:12:12,371
How many did you kill

504
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:13,538
to get out?

505
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:15,702
A lot.

506
01:12:16,802 --> 01:12:18,837
You will only have to kill one

507
01:12:19,405 --> 01:12:20,682
to get back in.

508
01:12:20,706 --> 01:12:23,809
The bastard who
murdered my father.

509
01:12:25,412 --> 01:12:27,978
Give me the name.

510
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:30,856
Killa Harkan.

511
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,463
You will find him
at Himmel and Hölle.

512
01:12:33,487 --> 01:12:36,300
When he's dead,
I will mend your ticket.

513
01:12:36,324 --> 01:12:38,630
And the Crest?

514
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:41,563
Harkan first, then we talk.

515
01:12:42,231 --> 01:12:43,930
Bring proof of death.

516
01:12:47,038 --> 01:12:48,867
I'll need a way in.

517
01:12:51,473 --> 01:12:53,069
I know a way.

518
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:55,511
Klaus will take you.

519
01:13:04,823 --> 01:13:06,115
I am Klaus.

520
01:13:10,788 --> 01:13:12,856
John. I am Klaus.

521
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:02,849
Please tell your mistress

522
01:14:02,873 --> 01:14:04,821
that I am honored
by this gesture

523
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:07,847
and I look forward to
our continuing partnership.

524
01:14:09,251 --> 01:14:10,553
I am Klaus.

525
01:14:17,523 --> 01:14:20,057
Mr. John Wick

526
01:14:20,658 --> 01:14:22,129
in the flesh.

527
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:26,965
The Baba Yaga.

528
01:14:28,206 --> 01:14:29,497
Must be Christmas, <i>ja?</i>

529
01:14:40,812 --> 01:14:42,717
Where are my manners? Please.

530
01:14:48,654 --> 01:14:50,791
A drink, Mr. Wick?

531
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:55,972
You were expecting me.

532
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:57,160
Not me.

533
01:14:58,331 --> 01:14:59,536
Him.

534
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:01,399
John?

535
01:15:04,108 --> 01:15:05,108
How are you?

536
01:15:07,145 --> 01:15:09,053
You knew I'd be here.

537
01:15:09,077 --> 01:15:10,844
I suspected it.

538
01:15:11,542 --> 01:15:12,780
Family.

539
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:20,722
That family
sold you out, Mr. Wick.

540
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,700
They gave you up

541
01:15:23,724 --> 01:15:26,189
in the vain hope
of saving themselves.

542
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:29,636
You see, that's why
I never trust the Cossacks.

543
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:32,397
They are dirty people.

544
01:15:35,701 --> 01:15:37,772
This is personal.

545
01:15:40,277 --> 01:15:41,974
I sense tension here.

546
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:45,821
Mr. Wick may probably feel

547
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:48,585
I'm responsible
for the death of a...

548
01:15:49,516 --> 01:15:50,818
mutual friend.

549
01:15:54,085 --> 01:15:57,154
But I didn't kill Koji.
You did, John.

550
01:15:59,491 --> 01:16:02,337
You know, this discord
between old friends,

551
01:16:02,361 --> 01:16:03,798
it saddens me.

552
01:16:05,203 --> 01:16:06,203
Allow me to help.

553
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:10,134
<i>Nein.</i>

554
01:16:11,538 --> 01:16:12,774
We have a deal.

555
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:16,714
Had.

556
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,250
The Marquis.

557
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:20,390
Hell, I doubt he'll
mind if it's bullets,

558
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:22,248
blades or a blind man.

559
01:16:43,071 --> 01:16:45,873
Is this for me, Mr...

560
01:16:47,176 --> 01:16:48,176
Nobody.

561
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:52,143
And, no, it's actually for him.

562
01:16:56,985 --> 01:17:00,120
Then take a seat, Mr. Nobody.

563
01:17:04,055 --> 01:17:05,860
Exciting, <i>ja?</i>

564
01:17:15,604 --> 01:17:18,972
So, you want to kill him.

565
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:22,943
You want to kill him.

566
01:17:24,315 --> 01:17:25,847
I want to kill him.

567
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:28,751
What about you, Mr. Wick?

568
01:17:29,419 --> 01:17:31,395
I'm going to kill you.

569
01:17:31,419 --> 01:17:32,727
Oh.

570
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:35,219
For Pyotr. Of course, <i>ja.</i>

571
01:17:36,761 --> 01:17:39,701
But it looks like
we have ourselves, uh,

572
01:17:39,725 --> 01:17:42,674
a genuine conundrum.

573
01:17:42,698 --> 01:17:46,201
A quandary, if you will.
A real-life dilemma.

574
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:49,200
So...

575
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:53,118
How about we play a game?

576
01:17:53,142 --> 01:17:54,271
One hand.

577
01:17:55,139 --> 01:17:57,307
The winner decides who lives...

578
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,810
and who does not.

579
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,828
All right.
What's the buy-in?

580
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:11,130
More than you can afford.

581
01:18:11,154 --> 01:18:12,998
Yeah, I'm one bullet away

582
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:15,226
from being a very rich man.

583
01:18:16,762 --> 01:18:18,130
Or a dead one.

584
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:23,168
Five-card draw.

585
01:18:47,297 --> 01:18:48,325
Mr. Wick.

586
01:18:49,465 --> 01:18:50,767
Mr. Wick?

587
01:19:14,052 --> 01:19:16,155
Dead man's hand, Mr. Wick.

588
01:19:20,164 --> 01:19:21,164
Well...

589
01:19:22,531 --> 01:19:24,130
I don't gamble.

590
01:19:26,765 --> 01:19:27,969
Let's see.

591
01:19:35,512 --> 01:19:37,753
Four nines. And a four.

592
01:19:37,777 --> 01:19:40,278
Most impressive.

593
01:19:52,122 --> 01:19:55,539
Ah. Royal flush.

594
01:19:55,563 --> 01:19:57,341
Pretty good for a nobody.

595
01:19:57,365 --> 01:19:58,527
Thank you.

596
01:20:00,572 --> 01:20:03,779
A blind man, a guy with a dog

597
01:20:03,803 --> 01:20:05,814
and John Wick walk into a bar

598
01:20:05,838 --> 01:20:09,282
and take a seat at the table.

599
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:11,422
That either sounds
like the beginning

600
01:20:11,446 --> 01:20:12,987
of a stupendous joke

601
01:20:13,011 --> 01:20:15,680
or a most
profitable opportunity.

602
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:22,023
One thinks he can
serve his way out.

603
01:20:26,429 --> 01:20:27,589
One...

604
01:20:28,864 --> 01:20:31,164
thinks he can buy his way out.

605
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:35,432
And one...

606
01:20:36,936 --> 01:20:38,402
thinks he can kill

607
01:20:39,476 --> 01:20:40,602
his way out.

608
01:20:43,347 --> 01:20:46,542
Each of them all think that
they have the winning hand.

609
01:20:47,947 --> 01:20:49,281
But what they fail

610
01:20:50,321 --> 01:20:51,755
to realize

611
01:20:51,779 --> 01:20:55,518
is that the moment they took
a seat at The Table...

612
01:20:58,892 --> 01:21:00,836
they had already lost.

613
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:03,361
Let me guess.
Five of a kind?

614
01:21:04,997 --> 01:21:06,093
Yeah.

615
01:21:13,544 --> 01:21:15,043
Just so you know,

616
01:21:16,305 --> 01:21:18,376
Pyotr wasn't personal.

617
01:21:20,177 --> 01:21:21,379
Now, maybe a little bit.

618
01:21:24,982 --> 01:21:27,822
Kill!

619
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:48,466
Hey! He's over there!

620
01:25:43,606 --> 01:25:45,709
Nuts!

621
01:26:14,277 --> 01:26:16,443
Know what your
problem is, Mr. Wick?

622
01:26:17,077 --> 01:26:19,512
You are unlucky.

623
01:26:20,982 --> 01:26:22,482
Unlucky in life,

624
01:26:22,982 --> 01:26:24,321
in love,

625
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,222
in friendship...

626
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:29,687
and now...

627
01:26:31,222 --> 01:26:32,692
in death.

628
01:27:32,187 --> 01:27:34,422
Killa!

629
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:25,968
Why don't you just die?

630
01:29:33,603 --> 01:29:34,839
He's mine.

631
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:38,954
I told you not to take a deal.

632
01:29:38,978 --> 01:29:41,417
Yeah, I guess your deal
didn't work out either, huh?

633
01:29:42,181 --> 01:29:43,992
Huh?

634
01:29:44,016 --> 01:29:46,554
Hell of a thing for them
to take your eyes, though.

635
01:29:51,226 --> 01:29:52,461
They didn't take them.

636
01:29:54,624 --> 01:29:55,827
I gave them.

637
01:31:32,124 --> 01:31:34,532
The Ruska Roma will support

638
01:31:34,556 --> 01:31:35,828
your challenge.

639
01:31:37,059 --> 01:31:38,633
Who will be your Second?

640
01:32:07,124 --> 01:32:09,961
A warning
of the cost of tyranny.

641
01:32:13,395 --> 01:32:16,707
You must intend
to join your concierge.

642
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,068
Not today.

643
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:27,290
Per the Old Ways
and the old laws,

644
01:32:27,314 --> 01:32:30,089
John Wick calls you to a duel.

645
01:32:30,113 --> 01:32:32,723
To settle your differences
the old-fashioned way,

646
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:34,755
as gentlemen should.

647
01:32:36,991 --> 01:32:39,353
You speak of the Old Ways
as if you know them.

648
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:42,572
A man of Mr. Wick's station

649
01:32:42,596 --> 01:32:44,358
cannot issue such a challenge.

650
01:32:45,995 --> 01:32:48,131
He has his family's crest.

651
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,135
Hmm.

652
01:32:53,108 --> 01:32:54,118
Berlin.

653
01:32:54,142 --> 01:32:55,578
Ruska Roma challenge,

654
01:32:55,602 --> 01:32:57,582
the acceptance of
Mr. Wick back into the fold,

655
01:32:57,606 --> 01:32:59,321
it's all there.

656
01:32:59,345 --> 01:33:01,078
Recorded history now.

657
01:33:09,624 --> 01:33:11,300
And why would I accept this

658
01:33:11,324 --> 01:33:12,936
from a second-rate seat?

659
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,265
Because there are
rules, and without them...

660
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:18,326
We live with
the animals. Exactly.

661
01:33:19,796 --> 01:33:20,999
Mm.

662
01:33:21,898 --> 01:33:23,364
Times are changing.

663
01:33:24,274 --> 01:33:25,678
A new day is dawning.

664
01:33:25,702 --> 01:33:28,644
New ideas, new rules,

665
01:33:29,509 --> 01:33:30,877
new management.

666
01:33:32,942 --> 01:33:35,053
Yet you will accept.

667
01:33:35,077 --> 01:33:39,060
Because we all still sit
beneath The Table.

668
01:33:39,084 --> 01:33:42,383
Even you are not immune
to the consequences of failure.

669
01:33:50,261 --> 01:33:53,328
And what exactly
are Mr. Wick's terms?

670
01:33:54,171 --> 01:33:56,707
<i>Victoriae fiducia.</i>

671
01:33:56,731 --> 01:34:01,710
The unconditional release of any
and all obligations to The Table.

672
01:34:16,054 --> 01:34:18,935
Ah, history is littered
with Marquis

673
01:34:18,959 --> 01:34:21,389
who were only remembered
by their servants.

674
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:23,259
But you...

675
01:34:25,161 --> 01:34:26,577
you could be remembered

676
01:34:26,601 --> 01:34:29,006
as the man who brought
John Wick,

677
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:30,740
the most feared of all

678
01:34:30,764 --> 01:34:33,368
by The Table and all
who sit at it, into the light.

679
01:34:34,838 --> 01:34:36,206
Your light.

680
01:34:38,447 --> 01:34:39,919
And who could predict

681
01:34:39,943 --> 01:34:42,019
how high that kind of glory

682
01:34:42,043 --> 01:34:44,445
could take a man in our world?

683
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:05,070
Noon, <i>La Tour Eiffel,</i>
to discuss rules.

684
01:35:05,935 --> 01:35:07,204
You may go.

685
01:35:08,377 --> 01:35:09,437
When I'm done.

686
01:35:10,879 --> 01:35:12,518
As his Second, upon his victory,

687
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:16,254
my Excommunicado is to
be lifted, my title restored,

688
01:35:16,278 --> 01:35:19,255
my hotel rebuilt
and re-consecrated,

689
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:21,350
all at The Table's expense.

690
01:35:23,688 --> 01:35:24,892
Of course.

691
01:35:35,135 --> 01:35:37,839
How you do anything
is how you do everything.

692
01:35:39,771 --> 01:35:40,974
Now I'm done.

693
01:35:45,079 --> 01:35:46,985
I think I'll miss you
when you're gone.

694
01:35:47,009 --> 01:35:49,081
Shame I can't say the same.

695
01:35:49,981 --> 01:35:51,512
You don't know, do you?

696
01:35:52,619 --> 01:35:54,797
What's that?

697
01:35:54,821 --> 01:35:57,965
A man's Second,
like his sponsor,

698
01:35:57,989 --> 01:36:00,062
either walks out
with his champion

699
01:36:00,086 --> 01:36:02,061
or is buried beside him.

700
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,163
The Old Ways.

701
01:36:13,409 --> 01:36:14,469
Such is life.

702
01:37:01,823 --> 01:37:03,962
Under the Old Laws,

703
01:37:03,986 --> 01:37:06,229
only one can survive.

704
01:37:06,253 --> 01:37:08,061
Do you both understand that?

705
01:37:11,798 --> 01:37:13,210
Very good.

706
01:37:13,234 --> 01:37:15,075
Rules.

707
01:37:15,099 --> 01:37:18,005
The Challenged
chooses first. Time?

708
01:37:19,836 --> 01:37:21,107
Sunrise.

709
01:37:26,744 --> 01:37:27,982
Now.

710
01:37:31,752 --> 01:37:33,086
Sunrise.

711
01:37:33,587 --> 01:37:34,587
Location?

712
01:37:35,722 --> 01:37:37,464
You come here

713
01:37:37,488 --> 01:37:40,027
thinking there is a way out of
this world for you, Mr. Wick?

714
01:37:42,058 --> 01:37:43,327
There is not.

715
01:37:46,195 --> 01:37:48,068
Le Centre Pompidou.

716
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:52,369
Sacré Coeur.

717
01:37:57,073 --> 01:37:58,342
Sacré Coeur.

718
01:37:59,546 --> 01:38:00,546
Weapons?

719
01:38:01,616 --> 01:38:02,957
If you win,

720
01:38:02,981 --> 01:38:05,052
The Table will honor its word.

721
01:38:06,152 --> 01:38:07,516
You will have your freedom.

722
01:38:08,921 --> 01:38:10,354
But you won't take it.

723
01:38:11,624 --> 01:38:12,624
Blades.

724
01:38:18,598 --> 01:38:19,935
Pistols.

725
01:38:24,668 --> 01:38:29,019
Dueling pistols.
Thirty paces.

726
01:38:29,043 --> 01:38:31,485
In the event that
both parties survive,

727
01:38:31,509 --> 01:38:34,953
each will approach the other
at increments of ten paces

728
01:38:34,977 --> 01:38:37,414
until only one remains.

729
01:38:38,852 --> 01:38:40,252
Rules of engagement.

730
01:38:41,524 --> 01:38:42,959
No quarter.

731
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:45,620
You know why you
won't take your freedom?

732
01:38:46,494 --> 01:38:47,523
Hmm?

733
01:38:49,029 --> 01:38:51,131
Because this is who you are,

734
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,562
who you've always been.

735
01:38:55,836 --> 01:38:57,665
You are a killer.

736
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:02,618
An orphan we plucked
from the street

737
01:39:02,642 --> 01:39:05,153
and honed into a knife.

738
01:39:05,177 --> 01:39:08,082
And it is the killing
that gives you purpose.

739
01:39:09,082 --> 01:39:11,019
A man without purpose...

740
01:39:12,819 --> 01:39:14,154
is nothing.

741
01:39:16,559 --> 01:39:17,751
No quarter.

742
01:39:19,387 --> 01:39:21,235
No quarter.

743
01:39:21,259 --> 01:39:24,170
If there is nothing else, gentlemen,

744
01:39:24,194 --> 01:39:26,001
I will see...
A nomination.

745
01:39:30,474 --> 01:39:31,567
It is his right.

746
01:39:33,338 --> 01:39:35,010
Do you have a name?

747
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:41,247
Caine.

748
01:39:43,785 --> 01:39:45,596
So be it.

749
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:47,583
Sunrise, Sacré Coeur.

750
01:39:49,188 --> 01:39:51,527
Dueling pistols, no quarter.

751
01:39:51,551 --> 01:39:54,071
Should Mr. Wick be victorious,

752
01:39:54,095 --> 01:39:55,968
he will be free of any
and all obligation

753
01:39:55,992 --> 01:39:57,633
to The High Table,

754
01:39:57,657 --> 01:39:59,975
and his Second
will be reinstated

755
01:39:59,999 --> 01:40:02,272
as the manager of the rebuilt

756
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:04,072
New York Continental.

757
01:40:05,773 --> 01:40:09,784
Should the Marquis Vincent
Bisset de Gramont be victorious...

758
01:40:09,808 --> 01:40:11,574
John Wick will be dead.

759
01:40:13,848 --> 01:40:15,380
As will his Second.

760
01:40:17,247 --> 01:40:18,995
Just so.

761
01:40:19,019 --> 01:40:20,391
Now, if there is
nothing more, gentlemen,

762
01:40:20,415 --> 01:40:22,626
I will see you at sunrise.

763
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:24,428
Failure to meet
at the appointed hour

764
01:40:24,452 --> 01:40:26,031
will result in forfeiture

765
01:40:26,055 --> 01:40:28,294
and immediate execution.

766
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:42,341
There is no John out there.

767
01:40:43,575 --> 01:40:46,345
No happy husband
with a normal life.

768
01:40:49,147 --> 01:40:50,580
There's only John Wick,

769
01:40:51,555 --> 01:40:52,648
the killer.

770
01:40:54,990 --> 01:40:57,125
And he's going to kill you.

771
01:41:03,799 --> 01:41:04,858
<i>Your hotel?</i>

772
01:41:05,963 --> 01:41:07,242
Yes.

773
01:41:07,266 --> 01:41:09,238
You always have
an angle, don't you?

774
01:41:09,262 --> 01:41:11,245
Doesn't everyone?

775
01:41:11,269 --> 01:41:15,118
Let's find safe harbor
before it starts.

776
01:41:15,142 --> 01:41:17,050
There's something
I need to do first.

777
01:41:17,074 --> 01:41:19,543
Sooner rather than later.

778
01:41:23,246 --> 01:41:24,893
Won't do it.

779
01:41:24,917 --> 01:41:26,451
You fight your own fight.

780
01:41:30,355 --> 01:41:32,193
Isn't this what you want?

781
01:41:33,925 --> 01:41:35,365
Hmm?

782
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:37,198
<i>Victoriae fiducia.</i>

783
01:41:38,228 --> 01:41:39,538
You kill him,

784
01:41:39,562 --> 01:41:41,598
and you and your
daughter will be free.

785
01:41:43,773 --> 01:41:45,272
No one can touch her.

786
01:41:46,775 --> 01:41:48,581
If you don't,

787
01:41:48,605 --> 01:41:51,443
she will have to face
the consequences.

788
01:41:53,013 --> 01:41:55,150
The choice is yours.

789
01:43:21,704 --> 01:43:22,765
Caine.

790
01:43:23,706 --> 01:43:24,833
John.

791
01:43:25,973 --> 01:43:27,341
Saying goodbyes?

792
01:43:29,273 --> 01:43:30,905
Saying hello.

793
01:43:36,185 --> 01:43:37,978
You think your wife
can hear you?

794
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:41,685
No.

795
01:43:45,256 --> 01:43:46,591
Then why bother?

796
01:43:48,732 --> 01:43:50,265
Maybe I'm wrong.

797
01:43:54,001 --> 01:43:55,600
The dead are gone.

798
01:43:59,172 --> 01:44:00,968
Only the living matter.

799
01:44:06,412 --> 01:44:08,712
After my daughter was born...

800
01:44:10,614 --> 01:44:12,281
I wanted to leave this life.

801
01:44:14,854 --> 01:44:16,291
I thought I did.

802
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,020
But you didn't.

803
01:44:22,293 --> 01:44:23,727
We're damned...

804
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:26,994
you and I.

805
01:44:28,465 --> 01:44:30,569
On that we agree.

806
01:44:34,636 --> 01:44:36,443
My daughter's not.

807
01:44:39,610 --> 01:44:41,679
If it's between you and her...

808
01:44:43,853 --> 01:44:45,485
you're going to die.

809
01:44:52,289 --> 01:44:53,856
Maybe not.

810
01:44:59,067 --> 01:45:00,599
I missed you, John.

811
01:45:02,668 --> 01:45:05,472
It's so good
to sit with a friend.

812
01:45:10,441 --> 01:45:12,545
I'll see you tomorrow.

813
01:45:42,608 --> 01:45:45,452
This is how you
resolve the situation?

814
01:45:45,476 --> 01:45:47,656
Duello with the Baba Yaga.

815
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:50,913
Failure will shake the
foundation of The High Table,

816
01:45:52,321 --> 01:45:55,555
and it will turn Wick
into a saint.

817
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:00,553
My victory will do the opposite.

818
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:04,729
Marquis de Gramont!

819
01:46:06,397 --> 01:46:08,539
A man's ambition

820
01:46:08,563 --> 01:46:10,900
should never exceed his worth.

821
01:46:13,772 --> 01:46:16,807
You would do well
to remember that, sir.

822
01:47:37,557 --> 01:47:39,534
<i>Bonjour,</i> Monsieur Wick.

823
01:47:39,558 --> 01:47:42,470
And welcome to <i>La Resistance.</i>

824
01:47:42,494 --> 01:47:44,634
A little far from home,
aren't you?

825
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:46,068
Well, your little act

826
01:47:46,092 --> 01:47:48,704
of uncivil disobedience
inspired me, John.

827
01:47:48,728 --> 01:47:50,376
I'm branching out,

828
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,679
spreading my wings.

829
01:47:52,703 --> 01:47:54,773
How goes the Grand
Farewell Tour?

830
01:47:56,442 --> 01:47:57,974
Coming to an end.

831
01:47:58,906 --> 01:48:01,241
So it seems. So it seems.

832
01:48:02,418 --> 01:48:04,519
Forty-two regular, wasn't it?

833
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,022
It's Kevlar, front to back.

834
01:48:07,046 --> 01:48:08,959
The latest in ballistic chic.

835
01:48:08,983 --> 01:48:10,830
Appropriate for
all formal occasions.

836
01:48:10,854 --> 01:48:14,031
Weddings, funerals,
High Table duels.

837
01:48:14,055 --> 01:48:15,767
After all, a man
has to look his best

838
01:48:15,791 --> 01:48:17,631
when it's time to get married.

839
01:48:19,166 --> 01:48:20,166
Or buried.

840
01:48:31,014 --> 01:48:32,074
Forgive me, sir,

841
01:48:32,841 --> 01:48:34,307
but this is madness.

842
01:48:35,511 --> 01:48:36,954
Madness?

843
01:48:36,978 --> 01:48:39,015
Trusting your fate
to a blind man?

844
01:48:40,315 --> 01:48:43,184
There are three types
of men in this world.

845
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:48,000
Those who have
something to live for,

846
01:48:48,024 --> 01:48:51,103
those who have
something to die for,

847
01:48:51,127 --> 01:48:53,970
and those who have
something to kill for.

848
01:48:53,994 --> 01:48:56,711
John Wick has
none of these things.

849
01:48:56,735 --> 01:49:00,036
He is but a ghost
in search of a graveyard.

850
01:49:01,473 --> 01:49:02,874
But the blind man,

851
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:05,679
well, he has all three.

852
01:49:07,414 --> 01:49:09,423
Besides, I have a feeling

853
01:49:09,447 --> 01:49:11,622
Mr. Wick will never make it

854
01:49:11,646 --> 01:49:13,819
to the duel by sunrise.

855
01:49:58,662 --> 01:50:00,206
All right, now.

856
01:50:00,230 --> 01:50:03,011
For all you boppers out there
in the City of Lights,

857
01:50:03,035 --> 01:50:06,976
for all you street people
with an ear for the action,

858
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,317
<i>to all my loyal listeners</i>

859
01:50:09,341 --> 01:50:12,319
<i>who know the beat
of the street...</i>

860
01:50:12,343 --> 01:50:16,957
<i>...tonight is your chance
to make some beautiful music.</i>

861
01:50:16,981 --> 01:50:20,494
I've been asked
to relay a special request

862
01:50:20,518 --> 01:50:22,349
<i>from a secret admirer.</i>

863
01:50:23,425 --> 01:50:25,031
<i>It seems there's a thorn</i>

864
01:50:25,055 --> 01:50:28,569
<i>in our little slice of paradise.</i>

865
01:50:28,593 --> 01:50:30,840
<i>A wicked man from the Big Apple</i>

866
01:50:30,864 --> 01:50:34,295
<i>is making a beeline
to our sacred heart.</i>

867
01:50:35,471 --> 01:50:36,878
<i>We are putting the call out</i>

868
01:50:36,902 --> 01:50:40,817
<i>to deliver your hardest beats
to this man in black.</i>

869
01:50:40,841 --> 01:50:45,221
<i>If you want the prize,
you must finish before sunrise.</i>

870
01:50:45,245 --> 01:50:47,389
This golden oldie,

871
01:50:47,413 --> 01:50:50,491
and I do mean golden hit,

872
01:50:50,515 --> 01:50:53,215
goes out to you, Mr. Wick.

873
01:50:55,118 --> 01:50:58,051
And remember,
there is nowhere to run.

874
01:52:03,856 --> 01:52:05,093
<i>I want to thank you all</i>

875
01:52:05,117 --> 01:52:09,333
<i>for listening to WUXIA,</i>

876
01:52:09,357 --> 01:52:12,573
<i>the place for
all your entertainment</i>

877
01:52:12,597 --> 01:52:14,775
<i>and informational needs.</i>

878
01:52:14,799 --> 01:52:16,264
<i>Good hunting.</i>

879
01:52:18,536 --> 01:52:20,203
And so it begins.

880
01:52:21,542 --> 01:52:23,844
I'm going to need a gun.

881
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:26,814
I thought you'd never ask.

882
01:52:28,142 --> 01:52:30,557
Nine-millimeter Pit Viper.

883
01:52:30,581 --> 01:52:32,323
How'd you get this?

884
01:52:32,347 --> 01:52:35,515
I know a guy who knows
a guy who shot a guy.

885
01:52:36,659 --> 01:52:38,368
Twenty-one round
capacity magazine

886
01:52:38,392 --> 01:52:39,435
with a built-in compensator

887
01:52:39,459 --> 01:52:41,337
for virtually no muzzle flip.

888
01:52:41,361 --> 01:52:43,306
Fiber-optic front sight,

889
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:44,970
ambidextrous safeties,

890
01:52:44,994 --> 01:52:47,575
flared magwell
for faster reloads,

891
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:49,613
two-pound extreme trigger,

892
01:52:49,637 --> 01:52:52,315
and for those more,
how shall we say,

893
01:52:52,339 --> 01:52:54,079
intimate encounters,

894
01:52:54,103 --> 01:52:57,240
this Viper has
ferocious fucking fangs.

895
01:53:02,113 --> 01:53:05,083
How close can you
get me to the church?

896
01:53:10,259 --> 01:53:11,320
Amen.

897
01:53:21,397 --> 01:53:24,069
Here we are, gentlemen.

898
01:53:25,604 --> 01:53:26,703
Your ride.

899
01:53:30,107 --> 01:53:31,488
When I advised you

900
01:53:31,512 --> 01:53:32,916
not to dip your pinky

901
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:34,756
back into this pond,

902
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:37,115
I didn't think I'd get wet.

903
01:53:39,887 --> 01:53:42,153
It'll all be over after today.

904
01:53:45,088 --> 01:53:47,290
When I was burying Charon,

905
01:53:49,231 --> 01:53:52,262
I was torn about what
to put on his gravestone.

906
01:53:53,528 --> 01:53:56,874
A few words to sum
up an entire life?

907
01:53:56,898 --> 01:54:00,012
Long live the king!

908
01:54:00,036 --> 01:54:02,107
Had mine made years ago.

909
01:54:03,476 --> 01:54:04,486
Modest.

910
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:06,441
Prophetic.

911
01:54:07,615 --> 01:54:09,246
What did you decide?

912
01:54:10,252 --> 01:54:12,058
Friend.

913
01:54:12,082 --> 01:54:14,581
That's what he was
above all else.

914
01:54:15,357 --> 01:54:16,484
A friend.

915
01:54:25,563 --> 01:54:28,199
<i>Au revoir et bonne
chasse, Monsieur</i> Wick.

916
01:54:29,933 --> 01:54:31,334
Thank you, King.

917
01:54:33,903 --> 01:54:35,173
Jonathan.

918
01:54:36,311 --> 01:54:37,445
Winston.

919
01:54:37,469 --> 01:54:40,417
Sunrise is at 6:03.

920
01:54:40,441 --> 01:54:43,181
Don't be late for
all our sakes, hmm?

921
01:54:52,726 --> 01:54:54,192
"Loving husband."

922
01:54:54,626 --> 01:54:56,165
Hmm?

923
01:54:56,189 --> 01:54:58,540
That's what I want on mine.

924
01:54:58,564 --> 01:55:01,232
"John. Loving husband."

925
01:55:31,026 --> 01:55:32,296
Confirmed.

926
01:55:33,636 --> 01:55:35,478
<i>Good news, boppers.</i>

927
01:55:35,502 --> 01:55:37,169
We have a sighting.

928
01:55:38,303 --> 01:55:40,112
<i>Our man in black
has been spotted</i>

929
01:55:40,136 --> 01:55:42,448
<i>in the</i> Septième Arrondissement.

930
01:55:42,472 --> 01:55:46,475
<i>I think it's high time
we paint him red.</i>

931
01:57:48,997 --> 01:57:53,182
It seems like our friends at
the guild dropped the ball,

932
01:57:53,206 --> 01:57:56,181
<i>and now it's rolling
to the Arc de Triomphe.</i>

933
01:57:56,205 --> 01:57:58,211
<i>Let's see who picks it up.</i>

934
02:00:03,001 --> 02:00:04,543
<i>Come on now, people.</i>

935
02:00:04,567 --> 02:00:06,735
We're gonna have
to do a lot better.

936
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:13,610
<i>Now, who's gonna be
our big winner?</i>

937
02:02:41,325 --> 02:02:42,735
Who is this?

938
02:02:42,759 --> 02:02:44,368
You know, the question
you should be asking,

939
02:02:44,392 --> 02:02:46,101
huh, is how much?

940
02:02:46,125 --> 02:02:48,532
I think we have
the situation under control.

941
02:02:57,343 --> 02:02:59,285
Because the way I see it,

942
02:02:59,309 --> 02:03:02,117
<i>is that if Mr. Johnny Boy
makes it to the church on time,</i>

943
02:03:02,141 --> 02:03:04,847
this could be your
last night as Marquis.

944
02:04:17,985 --> 02:04:19,964
<i>A little traffic update.</i>

945
02:04:19,988 --> 02:04:23,606
<i>I'm hearing the boys in black
couldn't get it done.</i>

946
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:26,508
<i>Our wicked friend
is on the move again.</i>

947
02:04:26,532 --> 02:04:30,570
He's headed your way,
my listeners of the 8th.

948
02:06:34,226 --> 02:06:35,204
Yes?

949
02:06:35,228 --> 02:06:37,667
Fine. You have a deal.

950
02:06:37,691 --> 02:06:39,541
All right. 35 it is.

951
02:06:39,565 --> 02:06:42,497
That wasn't our deal.

952
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:49,207
Well, that's the only deal
being offered today.

953
02:07:12,763 --> 02:07:13,993
Get him!

954
02:07:22,506 --> 02:07:23,608
Phone!

955
02:07:28,145 --> 02:07:30,257
What? Now, you listen to me.

956
02:07:30,281 --> 02:07:31,377
<i>Forty.</i>

957
02:07:32,815 --> 02:07:35,183
You pay for the service.

958
02:07:47,864 --> 02:07:49,934
<i>Good news, boppers.</i>

959
02:07:52,165 --> 02:07:54,466
The lottery just went up.

960
02:12:54,001 --> 02:12:58,020
<i>To all you boppers
still sitting on the side,</i>

961
02:12:58,044 --> 02:13:01,443
<i>Mr. Wick has
the church in sight.</i>

962
02:13:03,048 --> 02:13:05,794
<i>We are almost out of time.</i>

963
02:13:05,818 --> 02:13:07,828
<i>Last chance to win the prize</i>

964
02:13:07,852 --> 02:13:11,498
<i>before Mr. Wick's last sunrise.</i>

965
02:13:11,522 --> 02:13:16,260
<i>So who out there is going
to climb those 222 steps?</i>

966
02:17:55,101 --> 02:17:58,377
It appears Mr. Wick
won't be joining us.

967
02:18:17,293 --> 02:18:18,562
John?

968
02:18:21,263 --> 02:18:22,599
John?

969
02:18:24,134 --> 02:18:25,539
Caine.

970
02:18:25,563 --> 02:18:27,364
What time is sunrise?

971
02:18:30,470 --> 02:18:31,707
Two...

972
02:18:33,013 --> 02:18:34,545
maybe three minutes.

973
02:18:35,846 --> 02:18:39,077
I need you to get to the top
of those stairs, John.

974
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:44,390
Yeah.

975
02:18:51,491 --> 02:18:52,761
Ready?

976
02:18:53,394 --> 02:18:54,730
Yeah.

977
02:19:13,514 --> 02:19:14,915
Twelve or nine?

978
02:19:16,087 --> 02:19:17,115
Nine.

979
02:19:50,586 --> 02:19:52,425
Six upstairs. Thanks.

980
02:21:07,697 --> 02:21:09,231
<i>Ciao, ciao,</i> Mr. Wick.

981
02:21:22,709 --> 02:21:24,011
You can't shoot me.

982
02:21:28,122 --> 02:21:29,720
Yeah, you're right.

983
02:21:30,519 --> 02:21:31,722
But I can shoot him.

984
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,968
But I can hit you, motherfucker.

985
02:21:48,372 --> 02:21:49,641
Let's go, John.

986
02:22:15,632 --> 02:22:17,629
Nuts.

987
02:22:25,377 --> 02:22:26,843
You hit my puppy.

988
02:22:43,991 --> 02:22:45,191
You know, you owe me.

989
02:22:46,198 --> 02:22:47,198
Yeah.

990
02:22:55,871 --> 02:22:57,368
Nothing personal, John.

991
02:22:58,508 --> 02:23:00,140
We're even now.

992
02:23:01,181 --> 02:23:02,373
Yeah.

993
02:23:52,724 --> 02:23:54,799
And so we begin.

994
02:24:15,122 --> 02:24:18,892
We seek the truth and will
endure the consequences.

995
02:24:18,916 --> 02:24:21,386
Consequences.

996
02:24:41,006 --> 02:24:42,374
Go on now. Come on.

997
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:22,920
Positions, gentlemen.

998
02:25:35,933 --> 02:25:38,397
See you
in the next life, brother.

999
02:25:40,538 --> 02:25:42,137
Thirty paces.

1000
02:26:30,484 --> 02:26:32,891
Remember your
daughter. Fuck off!

1001
02:26:40,225 --> 02:26:43,132
What a beautiful sunrise.

1002
02:27:02,456 --> 02:27:04,483
Last words, Winston?

1003
02:27:05,855 --> 02:27:07,453
Just have fun out there.

1004
02:27:31,717 --> 02:27:33,578
Are you ready, Mr. Caine?

1005
02:27:40,327 --> 02:27:41,388
Mr. Wick?

1006
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:07,414
Fire!

1007
02:28:27,705 --> 02:28:29,403
Twenty paces!

1008
02:29:03,443 --> 02:29:04,471
Fire!

1009
02:29:16,357 --> 02:29:17,357
Nice.

1010
02:29:24,893 --> 02:29:26,691
Ten paces!

1011
02:30:17,012 --> 02:30:18,446
Just kill him.

1012
02:30:38,299 --> 02:30:40,501
Those who cling to death,

1013
02:30:42,102 --> 02:30:43,339
live.

1014
02:30:46,075 --> 02:30:48,278
Those who cling to life,

1015
02:30:49,482 --> 02:30:50,577
die.

1016
02:31:00,791 --> 02:31:02,127
Fire!

1017
02:31:41,063 --> 02:31:42,332
As your sponsor,

1018
02:31:44,630 --> 02:31:46,600
I claim the <i>coup de grâce.</i>

1019
02:31:50,373 --> 02:31:52,342
Your weapon, give it to me.

1020
02:31:53,176 --> 02:31:54,839
Is my daughter free now?

1021
02:31:56,214 --> 02:31:58,447
<i>Oui.</i> You and your daughter.

1022
02:31:59,113 --> 02:32:00,317
Enjoy.

1023
02:32:18,333 --> 02:32:19,864
Rules.
Ha.

1024
02:32:21,601 --> 02:32:24,440
You arrogant asshole,

1025
02:32:25,140 --> 02:32:26,706
he didn't shoot.

1026
02:32:27,912 --> 02:32:29,346
Consequences.

1027
02:32:45,424 --> 02:32:47,232
That's fucking good.

1028
02:32:59,271 --> 02:33:00,608
Hmm.

1029
02:33:07,416 --> 02:33:10,387
Your obligation to The Table...

1030
02:33:12,091 --> 02:33:14,228
is satisfied, John Wick.

1031
02:33:14,252 --> 02:33:15,524
You are free.

1032
02:33:20,628 --> 02:33:22,993
As are you
and your daughter, sir.

1033
02:33:25,835 --> 02:33:28,801
You will be fully
reinstated, Mr. Manager.

1034
02:33:30,107 --> 02:33:31,507
All of your terms

1035
02:33:32,846 --> 02:33:34,543

1036
02:33:40,386 --> 02:33:43,457
Our business here now
is concluded.

1037
02:33:43,481 --> 02:33:45,521
Good day.

1038
02:34:26,261 --> 02:34:27,464
My brother.

1039
02:34:30,771 --> 02:34:32,364
You owe me one.

1040
02:34:35,005 --> 02:34:36,066
Yeah.

1041
02:34:58,665 --> 02:34:59,793
Winston.

1042
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:01,993
Jonathan.

1043
02:35:04,597 --> 02:35:06,470
Will you take me home?

1044
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:14,808
Of course.

1045
02:36:48,402 --> 02:36:49,672
Helen.

1046
02:37:51,304 --> 02:37:53,571
Never thought I'd see the day.

1047
02:37:58,907 --> 02:38:01,876
Where do you think he is,
heaven or hell?

1048
02:38:07,580 --> 02:38:08,949
