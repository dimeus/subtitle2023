1
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:19,709
Let me tell you about
who first seduced us to do evil.

2
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,959
Lucifer,
to set himself in glory,

3
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:30,668
raised war in heaven against
the throne and monarchy of God.

4
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:34,168
Defeated by
the archangel Michael,

5
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:38,418
this fallen angel was cast
headlong into the lower realm.

6
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:53,168
Flaming as he fell through
the ethereal sky.

7
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:03,668
Down to bottomless damnation.

8
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:10,293
There to dwell
in unbreakable chains.

9
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,043
And punishing fire.

10
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:29,584
Shit.

11
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,293
Lucifer!

12
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:02,543
Is this really necessary?

13
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,751
Unchain me!

14
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:13,793
Michael!

15
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:18,251
Return as my ally and devoted
angel of the kingdom.

16
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:21,751
Better to reign in hell
than serve in heaven.

17
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,209
Michael!

18
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:31,584
I will one day shake free
and rise from these ashes.

19
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,959
I will return to you
but not as your ally,

20
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:36,418
nor your brother.

21
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:39,376
I shall return to you
as your master,

22
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:42,876
your creator,
your God!

23
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:19,876
Over time,

24
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:23,126
legions of demons
joined Lucifer in hell

25
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:25,501
as he plots his revenge.

26
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:43,084
On Earth, his disciples
erect a stronghold

27
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:46,501
to guard where Lucifer fell,
believing one day

28
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:49,501
he will rise through
this gateway to hell.

29
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:54,084
And rule our world.

30
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:24,543
Professor Russo!

31
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,168
Yes, Laura?

32
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:32,084
Please reconsider
approving my thesis.

33
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,793
The last thing
the Turin University

34
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,251
wants to hear is
a young American lecturing us

35
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:38,501
on what our great
Italian artists believed

36
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:39,709
or didn't believe.

37
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:41,376
I'm simply saying
that the artists

38
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:43,834
who filled your cathedrals
with angels and devils

39
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,876
knew they weren't real,
you know.

40
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:47,751
Like no actual good spirits
from above

41
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,293
or evil spirits from below.

42
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,209
There is no dark side.

43
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,709
- No dark side?
- Yeah.

44
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:56,834
Your thesis makes
for a boring movie

45
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:58,918
and an arrogant dissertation.

46
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:00,418
The answer is no.

47
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,918
Please, Dr. Russo,
can't we discuss this?

48
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:10,543
Why don't we discuss it later
at my apartment?

49
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:15,126
I prefer crowded large
open spaces.

50
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,584
Is that why you wear
a wedding band?

51
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,001
To keep us Italian men at bay?

52
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:22,793
It's obviously not working.

53
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,668
The DNA of Jesus of Nazareth
will be on display this week

54
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:31,543
in Turin, Italy.

55
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:33,501
Hundreds of thousands
will flock to witness

56
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,876
this historic event
as the Shroud of Turin,

57
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,251
the burial cloth of Jesus,
is unveiled.

58
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,918
Accompanying the Shroud
will be renowned

59
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:41,793
art work and sculptures
provided by the

60
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,584
Vatican Historical Society.

61
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:44,751
Thanks again.

62
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:45,793
Thank you for coming to church.

63
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,001
- Thank you.
- Ciao.

64
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:47,709
- Yes, thank you.
- Ciao, thank you.

65
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:48,834
Thank you.

66
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:51,168
- Laura.
- Hey.

67
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:53,126
- How's my art historian?
- Good.

68
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:54,168
Wonderful.

69
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:55,293
You won't be disappointed.

70
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,668
Here, you'll need this today.

71
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:57,501
Added security
for the exhibition.

72
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:00,126
Oh, nice.

73
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:03,501
Everyone is very excited.

74
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:05,293
There's only been
five showings of the Shroud

75
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,418
in the last 100 years.

76
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:07,793
Yeah, good crowd.

77
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,334
Ooh, sorry.

78
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,876
- Thank you.

79
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,751
Welcome to the exhibition
of the Shroud of Christ.

80
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:24,584
The world's most famous object
and most sacred.

81
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,293
Can you come here, please?

82
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,709
Before we go in
to see the Shroud,

83
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:30,501
I want to show you all
the images up close,

84
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:31,834
so that you get
a better idea of

85
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:33,334
what they look like.

86
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,668
So here we have
Christ's blood

87
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,668
from His crucifixion.

88
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:40,459
His image
from the resurrection.

89
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:43,876
We believe that Jesus died,
was buried,

90
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:45,043
and descended to the dead.

91
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,293
On the third day, he rose.

92
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,334
Intense bright light
emitted from his body

93
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:51,043
imprinted His image
on the Shroud.

94
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:55,043
The Shroud is a photograph
of the resurrection.

95
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:57,126
Hmm.

96
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,084
Didn't you say
you wanted to show me something?

97
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:01,209
I do.

98
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:02,168
Something very special.

99
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,418
Just this way.

100
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:06,876
See, I believe that
art tells

101
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:09,793
the story of our past
and hints at our future.

102
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:16,834
It's on loan for the exhibit.

103
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,459
He's here to protect the Shroud.

104
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:22,751
Saint Michael defeating
the devil.

105
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:26,501
The war of angels
was the first war

106
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:28,918
and the first evil.

107
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:31,001
Thankfully,
Michael defeated Lucifer

108
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:32,334
and bound him in hell.

109
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:35,584
But the struggle
of good versus evil

110
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:36,918
continues on
within each of us.

111
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:38,501
Exactly.

112
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:42,626
Evil is not some external,
mystical force.

113
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:45,584
It's personal.

114
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:48,334
I disagree.

115
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,876
It's much more than that.

116
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:53,168
This artist insisted that
the devil himself

117
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:54,543
sat for his portrait.

118
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,293
I think he may be right.

119
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,668
I know of many good people
who have endured

120
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:03,834
horrendous evil.

121
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,001
Other-worldly evil.

122
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:08,626
Yeah, so do I.

123
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:13,001
But when something happens
to someone we deeply love,

124
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:15,543
blaming it on the devil
doesn't fix anything.

125
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,876
It certainly doesn't
reduce the pain.

126
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:20,918
It's the only way
I can make sense of it.

127
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:25,043
The war in heaven
has come to Earth.

128
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:26,418
The devil never rests.

129
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:36,501
Lucifer would have
consumed us all

130
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:38,459
if Michael hadn't stopped him.

131
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:46,293
Many prophecies
of the devil returning to Earth

132
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,126
as a false god.

133
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,293
I pray he never
finds his way out.

134
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,418
But I must
find my way out.

135
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:01,501
May I leave you three alone
to get acquainted?

136
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:02,793
Sure.

137
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,168
Thank you, Father.

138
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:04,959
Enjoy.

139
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,376
Laura.

140
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:47,751
Father?

141
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:15,418
Just in time.

142
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,834
Several fires
have nearly consumed

143
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:21,834
the Shroud.

144
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:24,334
The last all but destroyed
this Cathedral.

145
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:25,751
God saved it.

146
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,959
Follow me, please.

147
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:30,001
We will go upstairs.

148
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:39,751
GUARD 2 [ON WALKIE-TALKIE]:

149
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:47,293
GUARD 2 [ON WALKIE-TALKIE]:

150
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,251
Goodbye. Thank you.

151
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,043
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

152
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:44,251
Go!

153
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:46,084
Shoo!

154
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,126
- Go!

155
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:52,001
Go!

156
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:54,543
Go!

157
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:56,834
Go!

158
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,751
Oh my God.

159
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:27,001
Uh, no, no.

160
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,751
Ah, badge, yes.

161
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,959
GUARD 2 [ON WALKIE-TALKIE]:

162
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:39,709
GUARD 2 [ON WALKIE-TALKIE]:

163
00:15:57,543 --> 00:15:58,418
Stop.

164
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,376
Stop this at once.

165
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:06,626
Stop this desecration.

166
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,251
Holy Michael.

167
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:11,084
Be our defense
against the devil.

168
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:13,418
Rebuke him!

169
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:15,709
No!

170
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,209
No.

171
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:26,418
Keep Satan in hell
and all his evil spirits

172
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,501
who desire the ruin of souls.

173
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:32,376
Join us here on Earth, Lucifer!

174
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:35,084
Saint Michael,
return to us I pray.

175
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,251
Take it.

176
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:40,543
Stop.

177
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,376
Don't kill her.

178
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,084
He might choose her.

179
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:47,001
No.

180
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:48,334
No, don't touch me.

181
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,293
Where are you taking me?

182
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,001
No, please.

183
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:01,168
Saint Michael...

184
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:04,626
...take my body.

185
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,793
Use it to defeat
this beast of Satan.

186
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:36,668
Help me!

187
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:38,543
Keep her quiet.

188
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:40,168
Help!

189
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:41,918
Who are you people?

190
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:44,209
No.

191
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,501
Michael.

192
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:47,918
Kill him.

193
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:14,584
Faster!

194
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:30,668
Thank you all for coming.

195
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:36,293
My name is Dr. Laurent.

196
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:41,418
To resurrect brilliance,
my colleagues visited

197
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:45,626
Santa Croce,
final resting place for

198
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:50,334
Machiavelli, Galileo, Michelangelo.

199
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,543
This Fort Knox of genetic
genius stores treasure

200
00:20:56,709 --> 00:20:58,543
much more valuable than gold.

201
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:03,418
Brilliant DNA,
which until now

202
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:05,293
was a puzzle that
could not be solved.

203
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:14,709
Today, I alone can bring
these dry old bones to life.

204
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:16,668
The result?

205
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:22,001
Children you can
honestly be proud of.

206
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:29,793
The past will become our future.

207
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:34,793
Once I resurrect history's
most influential people

208
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:38,918
from the dead,
I just need you to pay for it.

209
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:46,543
Ladies and gentlemen,
the risen Antonio Vivaldi.

210
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,376
And his proud parents.

211
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,918
Congratulations.

212
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,751
Thank you. Thank you so much.

213
00:22:02,918 --> 00:22:05,293
Next up for bid.

00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:09,293

the greatest sculptor

00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:14,543
and draftsman,
living or dead.

217
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,626

Tonight, prize possession,

00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:44,001
So we start the bidding tonight
at e10 million.

222
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:48,126
And there we have it,
just like that, 15 million.

223
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:49,626
20 million.

224
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:50,793
30 million.

225
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,126
Any advance on 30?

226
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:53,626
e40 million.

227
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:54,793

e70 million.

229
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,584
Any advance on
e70 million?

230
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:01,501
80 million.

231
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:06,334
80 million,
and 80 million going once.

232
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:08,084
Going twice.

233
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,751
90 million.

234
00:23:53,168 --> 00:23:54,084
Is the Shroud ready yet?

235
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:55,501
- Yes.
- Good.

236
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:07,543
Everything I have worked for
has been for this moment.

237
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:10,959
Prepare the surrogates.

238
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:13,293
He's waited long enough.

239
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:22,043
Lucifer will finally have
a worthy home.

240
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:34,418
Please make her stop.
Please, now.

241
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:35,834
Make her stop.

242
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,834
Hey, shhh. Hey.

243
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:40,501
Hey, Sophia. Shut up.

244
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:45,168
They're watching us.

245
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,126
Where am I?

246
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:49,751
Hell.

247
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:52,876
What?

248
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:56,334
Hey, where did they
get you from?

249
00:24:58,043 --> 00:25:00,501
Um, the Cathedral?

250
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:01,334
Cathedral?

251
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,043
You're a nun?

252
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:04,834
Shut up.

253
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:07,668
Shut up! Shut up!

254
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,334
Can you make her stop, please?

255
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:13,918
Hey, be quiet, be quiet.

256
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:15,501
Listen, listen,
what's your name?

257
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:18,001
Sophia. Sophia.

258
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:18,959
She speaks English.

259
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,501
Okay, okay. Okay.

260
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:22,001
Sophia, Sophia.

261
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:23,043
Hi, I'm Laura.

262
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:24,959
Okay, Sophia, look at me.

263
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:26,043
Look at me.

264
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:27,501
You want to get out of here?

265
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:31,918
- Yeah?
- Yes. Yes.

266
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:33,501
Yeah, so do I.

267
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:36,001
Okay.

268
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,626
Okay, so what we're gonna do?

269
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:38,376
What's your name?

270
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:39,251
It's Brenda.

271
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:40,876
- Brenda?
- Yeah.

272
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:42,418
What's your name?

273
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,043
- Alina.
- Alina.

274
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:47,293
We're gonna have to stay calm

275
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,793
and we're gonna
have to work together.

276
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,293
All of us.

277
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:50,918
Yes.

278
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:05,251
No, no, no,
don't you come near me.

279
00:26:05,418 --> 00:26:06,584
Don't touch me!

280
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:07,501
No!

281
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:10,126
Get away.

282
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,501
Off me.

283
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:42,168
No, no.

284
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,459
Bishop Bustamante is safe.

285
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:46,084
They're on their way.

286
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,459
Father Marconi.

287
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:12,293
How could you?

288
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:14,793
- My God.
- Oh.

289
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:15,626
How could you
let them take it?

290
00:27:15,793 --> 00:27:17,001
Father Marconi.

291
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,209
It's a miracle.

292
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:19,168
Oh, you're bleeding.

293
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,001
I'm calling an ambulance.

294
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:22,709
Don't bother.

295
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,043
Where were the protectors
of the Shroud?

296
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:27,543
Sorry? Protectors of--

297
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:29,501
Where were the protectors
of the Shroud?

298
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:33,626
Ah, my head.

299
00:27:33,793 --> 00:27:37,376
Cardinal Vincini was
charged with its protection.

300
00:27:37,543 --> 00:27:40,959
But he became
to be unstable.

301
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,501
Unstable?

302
00:27:42,668 --> 00:27:46,251
Prophecies of demonic beasts
and secret cults.

303
00:27:46,418 --> 00:27:47,793
What?

304
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,293
Wild visions of the devil
coming to Earth

305
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:54,126
and obvious dementia.

306
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:56,668
Have you read the Bible?

307
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,543
Pardon me? Yes.

308
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:04,501
He's taking security footage.

309
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:05,918
Where can I find
Cardinal Vincini?

310
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,293
Father Marconi.

311
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:08,043
As your superior,
I insist that you--

312
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:09,293
My superior?

313
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:11,168
Where is Vincini?

314
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:13,459
Where?

315
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:17,501
He is a hermit now.

316
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:21,709
He's living alone
in Saint Michael's Asylum.

317
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,334
Who is this girl?

318
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:36,668
She-- she's a friend of--

319
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:40,376
friend of yours.

320
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:42,626
Laura is an arts student
from America.

321
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:47,293
Well, listen to me.

322
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,793
This is very important.

323
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,334
Do not tell a soul
that I have been here.

324
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:51,251
- Yes.
- No.

325
00:28:51,418 --> 00:28:52,584
Yes, of course not.

326
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:57,001
By the way, who are you?

327
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,168
Exactly.

328
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:00,084
Now, there's something else.

329
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:01,584
I need a car.

330
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:03,084
You have a car.

331
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:05,668
I have a car.

332
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:06,626
Wait.

333
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:08,209
What about the police?

334
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:10,209
They would want
the missing footage.

335
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:13,334
Tell them a priest stole it
after a demonic woman killed him

336
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,126
and he came back to life.

337
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:17,293
Or make something up.

338
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:19,751
You don't want to get
sent to Saint Michael's Asylum

339
00:29:19,918 --> 00:29:21,418
for telling the truth now,
do you?

340
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:24,876
Do you mind?

341
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:26,084
No, please.

342
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:48,168

Easy, old man.

363
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,459
I come in peace.

364
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:55,709
You from Turin?

365
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,168
Did Bustamante send you?

366
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:02,751
Come to make your confession?

367
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:04,168
Excuse me?

368
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:07,251
For the sin of
not protecting the innocent.

369
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:12,209
For your indifference
to the sufferings of

370
00:33:12,376 --> 00:33:14,043
the children of God.

371
00:33:15,543 --> 00:33:17,751
I warned you fools for years.

372
00:33:17,918 --> 00:33:20,418
But you all thought
I'd lost my mind.

373
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:23,543
You still think this collar
gives you protection?

374
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:33,251
You're no priest.

375
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:37,751
Who are you?

376
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:41,084
The hound of heaven.

377
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,418
Michael.

378
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:48,043
Why are you here?

379
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:50,126
They stole the Shroud.

380
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:55,584
I have the surveillance footage
from the Cathedral.

381
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:57,418
Was it a woman?

382
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:58,626
An old woman?

383
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:00,459
Yes, it was.

384
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:03,793
Where is she?

385
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:08,501
This asylum was built
as a lookout.

386
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:13,293
Over here. Look.
Come here.

387
00:34:14,626 --> 00:34:15,543
See.

388
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:19,459
You remember where Lucifer fell?

389
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:23,293
Look. See.

390
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:31,418
Those who guard it
work for Lucifer's release.

391
00:34:31,584 --> 00:34:34,793
Don't call that devil
by his angelic name.

392
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:37,668
He can't escape.

393
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:40,001
I chained him there.

394
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:44,959
Come with me.

395
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,334
Scripture tells us the devil
will be shaken loose

396
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:48,584
from his chains.

397
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:50,126
The gate to hell
will be opened.

398
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:52,418
And he and his demons
will come to Earth.

399
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,251
Now is that time.

400
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:08,168
Two ancient beasts
who are of both worlds

401
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:10,209
have been charged
with his release.

402
00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:14,918
The woman, whom you've met.

403
00:35:18,043 --> 00:35:20,418
And the beast of the ground.

404
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:23,918
The only beast that
Satan allowed to come to Earth

405
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:25,043
before him.

406
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,918
There is nothing he wants more
than to fight his way

407
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:29,668
out of hell.

408
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,001
I know that.

409
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:32,876
I put him there.

410
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:35,251
And only I can free him.

411
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:37,126
You mean God?

412
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:47,876
These scrolls are from
the occult that guards the gate.

413
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:52,043
They believe their Lord,
like Jesus,

414
00:35:52,209 --> 00:35:54,793
would be born from innocence.

415
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:58,584
For centuries, they offered him
children for him to possess.

416
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:02,584
No! No!

417
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:04,168
Their young bodies
were not strong enough

418
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:05,418
to contain him.

419
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:06,876
Their suffering
was unspeakable.

420
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:08,501
And we did nothing.

421
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:11,668
The devil can't control
his pride or his rage.

422
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:14,626
Therefore, he cannot possess
a mortal body.

423
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:15,501
He'd destroy it.

424
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:16,709
Not any.

425
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:22,918
There is one body
that has held an eternal.

426
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:25,459
And now science
has given the devil

427
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,251
his way out of hell.

428
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,459
Not even my brother will dare
to inhabit such a body.

429
00:36:29,626 --> 00:36:31,376
Don't you see?

430
00:36:31,543 --> 00:36:33,334
It's why they stole the Shroud.

431
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:34,543
They needed DNA.

432
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:36,459
God would never allow it.

433
00:36:40,293 --> 00:36:42,334
Isn't that why He sent you?

434
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:47,834
God didn't send me.

435
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,793
Now get me to that stronghold.

436
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,084
Keep watch.

437
00:36:54,251 --> 00:36:56,334
I'll see to his destruction.

438
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:06,084
Sharpen it more.

439
00:37:11,168 --> 00:37:13,001
Find anything?

440
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:14,501
I don't need anything.

441
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:16,334
Why do you think they need us?

442
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:19,084
Sex.

443
00:37:20,793 --> 00:37:22,793
It's always sex.

444
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,209
And then they'll kill us.

445
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,501
No, fear gets us killed.

446
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:29,543
I know, okay?

447
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:31,001
I've had to fight before
to stay alive.

448
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:33,001
So find a weapon.

449
00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:39,168
Are you married?

450
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:44,793
My husband and child
were murdered.

451
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:48,668
I'm sorry.

452
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:50,168
It's okay.

453
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,376
We're gonna be fine, right?

454
00:37:58,418 --> 00:37:59,459
Yup.

455
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:01,001
No.

456
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:08,043
At the current exhibition
of the Shroud of Turin,

457
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:10,126
already attracting
over 2 million visitors,

458
00:38:10,293 --> 00:38:11,793
was abruptly closed today.

459
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,001
The spokesperson
for the Archdiocese of Turin

460
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,876
provided no official comment.

461
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,043
Sources within the Vatican,
however, did indicate

462
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:20,084
the shocking possibility
that the Shroud itself

463
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:21,334
has gone missing.

464
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:55,543
Oh, yes. Right.

465
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:28,418
DNA's complete.

466
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:32,751
The girl from the Cathedral.

467
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:34,376
Yes.

468
00:39:34,543 --> 00:39:35,751
Blood type matches.

469
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,168
Healthy.

470
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,959
Even her natural cycle
is fortuitous.

471
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:41,459
Prepare her as well.

472
00:39:42,876 --> 00:39:44,168
Hurry.

473
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:46,543
I can sense the hound sniffing.

474
00:39:52,168 --> 00:39:53,334
Ready?

475
00:40:24,626 --> 00:40:25,376
Hey.

476
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:43,501
No!

477
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,251
No!

478
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:20,918
No! No!

479
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:25,251
Get your fucking hands off me!

480
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:50,001
No.

481
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,834
Calm yourself down.

482
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:55,501
Who the hell are you?

483
00:41:56,376 --> 00:41:59,209
I'm the angel of the Lord.

484
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:00,876
Call me, "Liz".

485
00:42:01,043 --> 00:42:02,793
What are you doing to me?

486
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:04,876
We're implanting

487
00:42:05,043 --> 00:42:09,793
a fertilized egg
into your uterus.

488
00:42:12,084 --> 00:42:12,959
You sick fucking bitch!

489
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:19,834
It's a very important baby.

490
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:23,209
Please, please stop now.

491
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:24,584
Please.

492
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:28,251
When I first saw you
in the Cathedral,

493
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:35,376
your sketch of my Lucifer
was so inspired.

494
00:42:38,293 --> 00:42:41,501
I have never seen him
captured like that.

495
00:42:44,418 --> 00:42:49,584
And it's why I believe
you might be the one.

496
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:04,668
Is this where we part?

497
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:05,834
It is.

498
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:11,668
Following us since we left.

499
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:16,376
To light the darkness,
some flares.

500
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:17,834
You have the torch.

501
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:21,084
Be watchful.

502
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:23,543
The beast of the ground
dwells below.

503
00:43:25,209 --> 00:43:27,126
We have lost many
to his claws.

504
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:30,001
This won't kill him.

505
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:33,168
But it will slow him down.

506
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:41,001
May God be with you.

507
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,793
Is God with you?

508
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,501
This is my responsibility.

509
00:43:50,918 --> 00:43:52,418
I'll ask for permission later.

510
00:44:42,584 --> 00:44:43,543
No.

511
00:44:54,793 --> 00:44:55,793
Help. No, please. Please.

512
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,209
Help us!

513
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:00,001
Please.

514
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:05,084
Help me!

515
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:39,084
What is it?

516
00:45:46,793 --> 00:45:49,751
Oh God. Oh God, oh.

517
00:46:03,668 --> 00:46:06,668
Brenda. Stop it!

518
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:07,959
Stop!

519
00:46:25,918 --> 00:46:27,334
No!

520
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:36,043
Help me!

521
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:39,418
May the holy mother be found.

522
00:47:04,418 --> 00:47:06,668
No! I said, no!

523
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,459
Open the door!

524
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:10,501
Open the door!

525
00:47:10,668 --> 00:47:11,334
Open it!

526
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:23,251
Someone help me!
No! No!

527
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:24,751
Oh my God.

528
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:26,501
What the fuck are you doing?

529
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:27,918
Oh my God.

530
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:32,751
What is it?

531
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:38,709
No! No!

532
00:47:38,876 --> 00:47:40,626
No, let us out!

533
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:44,626
Please, please, stop!

534
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:46,584
- Stop!
- Stop!

535
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:47,459
No!

536
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:50,126
Let us out!

537
00:47:50,293 --> 00:47:51,793
- Stop!
- Stop!

538
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:57,001
No!

539
00:48:47,418 --> 00:48:48,543
What is this?

540
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:50,084
Did you hear that?

541
00:48:52,168 --> 00:48:53,418
What is it?

542
00:48:53,584 --> 00:48:55,168
What's that noise?

543
00:48:58,251 --> 00:48:59,709
What's there?

544
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:03,168
What the fuck is that?

545
00:49:05,918 --> 00:49:07,459
Do you-- do you see anything?

546
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:17,668
No! No!

547
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:26,793
We're gonna die here.

548
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:31,584
Ah, no!

549
00:49:33,876 --> 00:49:35,251
No!

550
00:49:49,959 --> 00:49:50,501
Brenda!

551
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:15,543
Help me.

552
00:50:17,334 --> 00:50:18,751
Brenda.
Brenda.

553
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:34,709
No. No!

554
00:52:16,126 --> 00:52:18,168
The chosen one!

555
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:53,209
You've found favor
and will bring forth a son.

556
00:52:58,834 --> 00:53:00,876
What's in me?

557
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:02,959
A new Jesus.

558
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:04,584
What?

559
00:53:05,334 --> 00:53:07,543
A better Jesus.

560
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:48,626
Put it down.

561
00:54:48,793 --> 00:54:49,918
Put it down! Put it down.

562
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:13,334
Excuse me.

563
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:14,293
What are you doing here?

564
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:15,876
Nobody's allowed in--

565
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:18,084
No, what have you done?
What have you done?

566
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,126
Why did you take the Shroud?

567
00:56:21,293 --> 00:56:22,959
Who are you?

568
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:24,293
Why?

569
00:56:26,001 --> 00:56:28,876
A new beginning.

570
00:56:36,418 --> 00:56:37,876
No. Don't take--

571
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:40,793
No.

572
00:56:52,459 --> 00:56:53,251
That's him! There!

573
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:55,209
You guys smell that?

574
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:59,168
It smells like smoke
or something.

575
00:57:08,126 --> 00:57:09,793
Is that a fire?

576
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,501
Oh, don't just stand there,
we need to get out of here.

577
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:21,751
Father Marconi?

578
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:23,709
Oh my God!

579
00:57:25,168 --> 00:57:27,709
I thought you died.

580
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:29,251
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

581
00:57:29,418 --> 00:57:30,418
We need to get you out of here.

582
00:57:30,584 --> 00:57:31,751
Michael.

583
00:57:31,918 --> 00:57:35,418
Yes. Yes, come on, let's go.
Come on.

584
00:57:35,584 --> 00:57:36,334
What's the matter?

585
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:38,168
- Brother.
- What?

586
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:40,543
Come on,
let's get out of here.

587
00:57:40,709 --> 00:57:42,251
Something's not right.

588
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:43,126
I can sense him.

589
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,126
Father Marconi.

590
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:46,209
I'm not Father Marconi.

591
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:49,793
No, you're not.

592
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:53,084
You're one of them.

593
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:00,001
Laura.

594
00:58:00,168 --> 00:58:02,293
Laura! Laura!

595
00:58:09,043 --> 00:58:10,168
Get away from me!

596
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,209
I'm not one of them.

597
00:58:30,543 --> 00:58:32,209
Who the hell are you then?

598
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:34,251
Father Marconi is dead.

599
00:58:35,584 --> 00:58:39,959
I'm just borrowing him
for a bit.

600
00:58:40,126 --> 00:58:41,168
What?

601
00:58:47,626 --> 00:58:49,126
What did they do to you?

602
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:52,543
I don't know how
you live in these things.

603
00:58:57,168 --> 00:58:58,251
What did they do?

604
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:04,293
They did experiments on us.

605
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,918
What type of experiments?

606
00:59:09,668 --> 00:59:10,834
They raped me.

607
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:16,668
They uh-- they implanted me
with something.

608
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:18,418
It was horrible.

609
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:19,251
Are you pregnant?

610
00:59:19,418 --> 00:59:21,334
No! No!

611
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:22,501
I don't know.

612
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:25,126
It changes everything.

613
00:59:25,293 --> 00:59:26,793
Please, can we just
get out of here?

614
00:59:39,168 --> 00:59:41,293
Turn the damn alarm off.

615
00:59:43,001 --> 00:59:44,751
The Shroud is gone.

616
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:46,251
Go and find it.

617
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:48,376
Follow me.

618
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,668
I know Michael is here.

619
00:59:50,334 --> 00:59:51,834
This way.

620
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:53,001
Through here.

621
00:59:54,626 --> 00:59:55,751
No!

622
00:59:59,168 --> 01:00:00,834
Damn fool, you.

623
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:03,168
Not a finger on her!

624
01:00:20,418 --> 01:00:21,334
What's wrong?

625
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:22,126
My stomach.

626
01:00:24,168 --> 01:00:25,418
What is that?

627
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:27,959
Shit.

628
01:00:28,126 --> 01:00:29,251
Let's go!

629
01:00:31,584 --> 01:00:32,751
Through here.

630
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:38,959
Slip through here.
Come on!

631
01:00:39,126 --> 01:00:40,501
Come on.

632
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:48,459
Get down!

633
01:00:50,626 --> 01:00:51,668
Come on!

634
01:00:53,543 --> 01:00:54,793
This way.

635
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:56,043
It's just through here.

636
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:10,168
Come on. It's okay.

637
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:13,376
Ah!

638
01:01:13,543 --> 01:01:14,501
Are you okay?

639
01:01:14,668 --> 01:01:16,709
Yes, just stay there.

640
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,626
What are you doing?

641
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:23,376
Hurry.

642
01:01:23,543 --> 01:01:24,334
It's coming back.

643
01:01:27,876 --> 01:01:28,668
Come on.

644
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:29,918
Stay down, stay down.

645
01:01:30,084 --> 01:01:31,501
Where'd he go?

646
01:01:33,251 --> 01:01:33,751
Where'd he go?

647
01:01:34,626 --> 01:01:35,168
Watch out!

648
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,251
Ah!

649
01:02:04,418 --> 01:02:05,543
No.

650
01:02:06,793 --> 01:02:07,918
No!

651
01:02:16,376 --> 01:02:18,334
Stupid little girl.

652
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,918
Get her back safely.

653
01:02:22,793 --> 01:02:24,834
If you hurt him,
I'll kill the baby.

654
01:02:25,001 --> 01:02:26,376
You wouldn't dare.

655
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:29,126
I'll have my chance.

656
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:31,876
Ow!

657
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:34,168
Accept what is
happening to you, Laura.

658
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,709
It would be much easier
this way.

659
01:02:36,876 --> 01:02:38,918
I killed your priest...

660
01:02:41,668 --> 01:02:44,126
...and I'm going to
kill the angel within it.

661
01:02:46,293 --> 01:02:48,209
Go, find the Shroud.

662
01:02:48,376 --> 01:02:50,293
Without it,
we only have her.

663
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:19,668
Oh, you caused
quite a stir tonight.

664
01:03:21,668 --> 01:03:26,459
This can be your second chance
to live the life you lost.

665
01:03:26,626 --> 01:03:27,793
You sick bitch.

666
01:03:27,959 --> 01:03:29,751
You've no idea who I am!

667
01:03:29,918 --> 01:03:31,751
Calm down!

668
01:03:34,251 --> 01:03:38,001
This pregnancy
will be like no other.

669
01:03:38,168 --> 01:03:40,543
Prepare yourself.

670
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:43,668
He can't wait to meet you.

671
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:15,626
No visual of the Shroud. Over.

672
01:04:17,459 --> 01:04:18,293
DR. LAURENT

Keep searching.

673
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:36,668
I'm coming to find you, brother.

674
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:20,084
The fetus is healthy.

675
01:06:10,168 --> 01:06:12,626
No, no.

676
01:06:12,793 --> 01:06:14,293
Why?

677
01:06:21,293 --> 01:06:22,876
Where is my sword?

678
01:06:25,126 --> 01:06:27,918
Now it's your turn
to rot in hell.

679
01:06:30,084 --> 01:06:31,126
Mammon?

680
01:06:32,126 --> 01:06:33,668
Michael.

681
01:06:33,834 --> 01:06:35,793
You look pale
without your sword.

682
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:37,209
Where is he?

683
01:06:37,376 --> 01:06:39,293
Up with the mortals.

684
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:42,709
We'll join him soon.

685
01:06:42,876 --> 01:06:46,293
Then we'll close the gateway
between the two worlds.

686
01:06:46,459 --> 01:06:50,001
And you,
you'll be imprisoned here.

687
01:06:50,168 --> 01:06:51,251
And we'll rule the Earth.

688
01:06:51,418 --> 01:06:53,334
I chained him!

689
01:06:53,501 --> 01:06:55,834
God would never set him free.

690
01:07:00,918 --> 01:07:02,376
Foolish.

691
01:07:02,543 --> 01:07:05,126
To take a mortal body
down here.

692
01:07:07,876 --> 01:07:09,668
Now you're trapped in it.

693
01:07:09,834 --> 01:07:12,334
Chain him
with Lucifer's sword.

694
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:40,501
Look at him.

695
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:46,126
He's given you
what you have lost.

696
01:07:46,293 --> 01:07:49,709
This child will never replace
what I lost.

697
01:07:49,876 --> 01:07:51,709
He'll give you even more.

698
01:07:55,793 --> 01:07:57,376
Look.

699
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:01,334
Mommy.

700
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:08,876
Did he speak to you?

701
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:14,209
What?

702
01:08:15,084 --> 01:08:15,876
In your dream.

703
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:17,293
Did he say anything?

704
01:08:20,043 --> 01:08:20,834
Laura.

705
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:25,001
I want to tell you a story.

706
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:31,334
About a brave warrior
who stood up to

707
01:08:31,501 --> 01:08:33,293
a gloating tyrant.

708
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:36,709
How long have I been asleep?

709
01:08:36,876 --> 01:08:39,418
The warrior and the tyrant
were equal.

710
01:08:40,668 --> 01:08:44,626
But the tyrant demanded
that the warrior bend his knee

711
01:08:44,793 --> 01:08:46,834
and be his slave.

712
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,709
What's happening to me?

713
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:02,959
Our warrior,
the brightest of all, refused.

714
01:09:05,668 --> 01:09:07,959
He fought to free us.

715
01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:11,876
He would be soon free
and fight for us again.

716
01:09:12,043 --> 01:09:14,334
I don't give a shit about
your story about

717
01:09:14,501 --> 01:09:16,126
this goddamn demon seed, okay?

718
01:09:16,293 --> 01:09:16,709
I--

719
01:09:19,043 --> 01:09:20,959
He suffered for you!

720
01:09:22,084 --> 01:09:25,334
And the least you can do is--

721
01:09:29,043 --> 01:09:30,209
Laura.

722
01:09:34,751 --> 01:09:40,334
He's perfecting your body,
so you carry

723
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:42,376
and protect the child.

724
01:09:43,626 --> 01:09:46,251
I want him out of me.

725
01:09:49,168 --> 01:09:51,334
I know, Laura. I know.

726
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:53,126
This is difficult.

727
01:09:53,293 --> 01:09:57,043
Yeah, you kidnapped me,
put this thing inside me

728
01:09:57,209 --> 01:09:59,043
and now hold me prisoner.

729
01:09:59,209 --> 01:10:01,959
Yeah, it's a bit difficult.

730
01:10:02,126 --> 01:10:06,709
Once the child is born,
you'll be free.

731
01:10:07,334 --> 01:10:08,876
I promise.

732
01:10:10,751 --> 01:10:13,959
But for now, I control you.

733
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:16,709
And I demand respect.

734
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:43,501
Doll!

735
01:10:48,084 --> 01:10:49,209
Say quick, angel or demon?

736
01:10:49,376 --> 01:10:50,918
Stay away from him, Doll.

737
01:11:00,459 --> 01:11:01,501
Who are you?

738
01:11:01,668 --> 01:11:03,376
How did you get here?

739
01:11:03,543 --> 01:11:05,126
We're the Stolen.

740
01:11:05,293 --> 01:11:06,918
They stole us for Lucifer.

741
01:11:08,376 --> 01:11:09,626
We just want to go home.

742
01:11:09,793 --> 01:11:12,209
We don't belong here.

743
01:11:13,543 --> 01:11:14,459
Do you want to join us?

744
01:11:14,626 --> 01:11:15,751
Take the pledge.

745
01:11:15,918 --> 01:11:17,001
If one gets free--

746
01:11:17,168 --> 01:11:18,334
- All go home.
- All go home.

747
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:19,834
You're a fool to trust
any angel.

748
01:11:20,001 --> 01:11:21,168
Say it.

749
01:11:23,084 --> 01:11:26,834
If one gets free, all go home.

750
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:28,459
What's your name, angel?

751
01:11:29,293 --> 01:11:30,918
Michael.

752
01:11:31,084 --> 01:11:32,126
The archangel.

753
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:35,376
Show us. Soar to the heavens.

754
01:11:39,668 --> 01:11:41,459
Bring me my sword and I will.

755
01:11:42,668 --> 01:11:44,001
Sword?

756
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:50,043
It's about this big,
silver, gold, sharp.

757
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:52,168
Yeah, we know
what a sword looks like.

758
01:11:52,334 --> 01:11:53,751
If there was a sword, we'd know.

759
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:55,251
We're scroungers,
that's how we survive.

760
01:11:55,418 --> 01:11:57,626
There is no sword to save you.

761
01:11:57,793 --> 01:11:59,543
Just use your power.

762
01:11:59,709 --> 01:12:00,668
You're the archangel,
aren't you?

763
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:02,793
They're here!

764
01:12:08,084 --> 01:12:09,668
Run!

765
01:12:16,293 --> 01:12:18,501
Doll, they got Zar!

766
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:19,501
Get off me!

767
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,126
Leave them be!

768
01:12:22,293 --> 01:12:24,084
No!

769
01:13:31,084 --> 01:13:34,751
I will give your painful life meaning.

770
01:13:40,543 --> 01:13:43,293
Did you kill my husband?

771
01:13:46,543 --> 01:13:47,834
My child?

772
01:13:48,001 --> 01:13:49,084
No.

773
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:51,751
I've given you a child to love.

774
01:13:51,918 --> 01:13:54,709
I hate what that murderer
did to you.

775
01:13:54,876 --> 01:13:57,293
He took everything from you.

776
01:13:57,459 --> 01:14:01,626
I fear some of the nurses here
might do the same.

777
01:14:01,793 --> 01:14:04,418
You should do something
about it.

778
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:09,709
I hate her.

779
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:11,834
Liz envies you.

780
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:13,251
If you like,

781
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:16,334
I'll let you kill her.

782
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:18,918
If that pleases you, Laura.

783
01:14:21,584 --> 01:14:22,751
Very much.

784
01:14:56,251 --> 01:14:59,459
I cannot come to Earth
without you.

785
01:14:59,626 --> 01:15:01,751
Give yourself to me.

786
01:15:03,584 --> 01:15:06,418
As I have given myself to you.

787
01:15:34,293 --> 01:15:35,668
The child is a drain
on her health.

788
01:15:35,834 --> 01:15:37,126
We have to do something.

789
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:40,043
Laura is not getting weaker.

790
01:15:40,209 --> 01:15:43,126
She is bonding with the child.

791
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:45,709
I can feel
she's getting stronger.

792
01:16:23,126 --> 01:16:23,793
Hello.

793
01:16:59,834 --> 01:17:02,293
What are you doing to me?

794
01:17:04,168 --> 01:17:06,001
Oh my God.

795
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:11,501
I have to kill you.

796
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,001
Mother, no.

797
01:17:38,876 --> 01:17:41,876
Laura, stop this now.

798
01:17:48,084 --> 01:17:49,876
No!

799
01:17:59,334 --> 01:18:01,209
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
No!

800
01:18:08,043 --> 01:18:09,126
No!

801
01:18:09,293 --> 01:18:11,251
No!

802
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:34,251
Where is she?

803
01:18:40,959 --> 01:18:42,459
Open the door!

804
01:18:46,043 --> 01:18:47,959
Laura!

805
01:18:56,668 --> 01:18:57,543
All gone.

806
01:18:57,709 --> 01:19:00,126
How dare you, bitch!

807
01:19:06,126 --> 01:19:08,668
Go, go, get Laurent.

808
01:19:13,084 --> 01:19:17,709
You have no idea
what suffering means,

809
01:19:18,293 --> 01:19:21,418
until you live
our eternal misery,

810
01:19:21,584 --> 01:19:24,084
living in the dark
and in the dirt.

811
01:19:24,251 --> 01:19:27,959
And you,
you want to kill our Christ!

812
01:19:28,126 --> 01:19:30,001
You are the monster.

813
01:19:32,668 --> 01:19:34,334
You will be gone soon.

814
01:19:35,709 --> 01:19:38,376
Lucifer will consume you.

815
01:19:38,543 --> 01:19:40,709
But don't fear.

816
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:44,793
Full possession is a comfort.

817
01:19:44,959 --> 01:19:46,334
Like death.

818
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:52,918
All your silly independence
will end.

819
01:20:29,251 --> 01:20:31,959
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
How do you like it?

820
01:20:41,918 --> 01:20:47,251
No more mistakes.

821
01:20:47,459 --> 01:20:49,918
Lucifer, forgive me.

822
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:08,626
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
I'm weary of Laura's womb.

823
01:21:08,793 --> 01:21:13,709
Being stuck up inside
her stinking mess.

824
01:21:13,876 --> 01:21:17,501
I wish it could be
you inside of me.

825
01:21:19,001 --> 01:21:22,501
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Ah, baby.

826
01:21:23,876 --> 01:21:27,501
You have always been beside me.

827
01:21:28,959 --> 01:21:32,376
We've always been
one and the same.

828
01:21:36,793 --> 01:21:38,959
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
The same?

829
01:21:39,126 --> 01:21:42,376
Ah!

830
01:21:48,918 --> 01:21:51,168
After the birth,
no one can live

831
01:21:51,334 --> 01:21:53,084
who knows what happened here.

832
01:21:53,251 --> 01:21:54,751
Of course.

833
01:21:54,918 --> 01:21:57,626
And we will close the hell hole
with explosives

834
01:21:57,793 --> 01:21:59,668
after your army ascends.

835
01:21:59,834 --> 01:22:01,543
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Good.

836
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:04,876
Hell shall come to Earth.

837
01:22:05,876 --> 01:22:07,043
Yes.

838
01:22:07,209 --> 01:22:09,251
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
There is something else.

839
01:22:09,418 --> 01:22:12,209
I thought Laura
would come to love me.

840
01:22:12,376 --> 01:22:15,334
How I loathe that fucking whore.

841
01:22:17,001 --> 01:22:19,334
Even worse,

842
01:22:20,626 --> 01:22:23,001
the child has come to love her.

843
01:22:24,459 --> 01:22:28,626
He is willful
and wants his mommy.

844
01:22:29,793 --> 01:22:31,584
I didn't expect this.

845
01:22:32,751 --> 01:22:34,043
Oh well,

846
01:22:35,334 --> 01:22:39,251
once I'm born,
kill her.

847
01:22:40,876 --> 01:22:42,959
That will be my pleasure.

848
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:51,209
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
And you, do something to
stop this bitch from killing me.

849
01:23:06,918 --> 01:23:08,834
This could be me.

850
01:23:13,626 --> 01:23:14,793
Should have been me.

851
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:27,251
Saint Michael,
protect us against

852
01:23:27,418 --> 01:23:29,626
the snares and wickedness
of the devil.

853
01:23:39,001 --> 01:23:42,209
I pray God sends you help
and reveals to you

854
01:23:42,376 --> 01:23:44,251
how to defeat this evil.

855
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:21,251
Oh, you are miserable, brother.

856
01:26:30,376 --> 01:26:32,209
Why did God set you free?

857
01:26:33,668 --> 01:26:35,001
He fears me.

858
01:26:35,168 --> 01:26:36,626
He does not fear you.

859
01:26:36,793 --> 01:26:38,626
Which is why
you must lead my army

860
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:39,959
against Him.

861
01:26:40,126 --> 01:26:43,001
Then, we will be free.

862
01:26:44,959 --> 01:26:45,876
No.

863
01:26:47,334 --> 01:26:50,459
The last thing you want
is for others to be free.

864
01:26:51,501 --> 01:26:52,209
You're a tyrant.

865
01:26:52,376 --> 01:26:53,918
You fool!

866
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:58,043
My angels are coming
to end you.

867
01:26:58,209 --> 01:27:01,084
You are powerless
without your sword

868
01:27:01,251 --> 01:27:02,751
of the spirit.

869
01:27:05,126 --> 01:27:07,001
Thank you, Michael.

870
01:27:08,418 --> 01:27:09,668
For what?

871
01:27:09,834 --> 01:27:12,084
For failing.

872
01:27:12,251 --> 01:27:14,459
For this revenge.

873
01:27:14,626 --> 01:27:16,168
But most of all,...

874
01:27:18,793 --> 01:27:20,918
...for my new home.

875
01:27:22,126 --> 01:27:24,876
I will now control
the Earthly body of

876
01:27:25,043 --> 01:27:27,209
God's precious son.

877
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:30,543
The ultimate "fuck you, Daddy".

878
01:27:50,251 --> 01:27:51,709
Of course.

879
01:27:53,876 --> 01:27:57,376
I've been blind, foolish.

880
01:27:58,459 --> 01:27:59,334
Forget him, Doll!

881
01:27:59,501 --> 01:28:01,084
He's our last hope.

882
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:04,001
I forgot that there are those
more powerful than me.

883
01:28:05,626 --> 01:28:09,084
And every scheme of the devil
will be turned against him.

884
01:28:09,251 --> 01:28:10,626
He's just bait
for us to get caught.

885
01:28:10,793 --> 01:28:11,626
Come help us, Grunt!

886
01:28:11,793 --> 01:28:13,334
I need to get to Laura.

887
01:28:13,501 --> 01:28:15,001
Come on, quickly.

888
01:28:15,168 --> 01:28:16,084
They'll be coming for you.

889
01:28:16,251 --> 01:28:17,876
Bring me my sword.

890
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:18,668
Quickly!

891
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:19,793
Listen to me!

892
01:28:19,959 --> 01:28:21,376
I need my sword.

893
01:28:21,543 --> 01:28:23,834
And Grunt, I can set you free.

894
01:28:26,543 --> 01:28:29,251
No, come on Doll. Come on!

895
01:28:29,418 --> 01:28:30,584
Don't--

896
01:28:31,793 --> 01:28:32,793
Listen to me.

897
01:28:32,959 --> 01:28:34,084
Bring me my sword!

898
01:28:34,251 --> 01:28:34,959
Is there any other way?

899
01:28:35,126 --> 01:28:35,918
No!

900
01:28:36,084 --> 01:28:36,751
Come on!

901
01:28:36,918 --> 01:28:38,293
Grunt, come on.

902
01:28:38,459 --> 01:28:39,543
Come on.

903
01:28:41,209 --> 01:28:42,126
They're coming, they're coming!

904
01:28:42,293 --> 01:28:43,834
Michael, get out!

905
01:28:46,709 --> 01:28:47,168
Help!

906
01:28:47,334 --> 01:28:48,251
Help him!

907
01:28:48,418 --> 01:28:49,626
Help me, Doll!

908
01:28:49,793 --> 01:28:51,209
Hurry!

909
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:53,584
Help me!

910
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,876
I need my sword.

911
01:29:02,918 --> 01:29:04,751
Stop!

912
01:29:04,918 --> 01:29:07,501
Give me the sword
and I'll spare you.

913
01:29:07,668 --> 01:29:09,168
Can you get us home?

914
01:29:09,334 --> 01:29:10,668
Of course, I can.

915
01:29:10,834 --> 01:29:12,084
- What are you doing?
- Grunt.

916
01:29:12,251 --> 01:29:13,793
Bring it to me.
And I will free you.

917
01:29:13,959 --> 01:29:15,584
Don't listen to him.
He's a liar.

918
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:16,501
Grunt, you have to trust me!

919
01:29:16,668 --> 01:29:17,793
No, no!

920
01:29:17,959 --> 01:29:18,709
Bring it to me!

921
01:29:18,876 --> 01:29:19,668
We don't know him, Doll.

922
01:29:19,834 --> 01:29:20,834
But this is different.

923
01:29:21,001 --> 01:29:22,376
We've been burned before.

924
01:29:22,543 --> 01:29:23,418
Please.

925
01:29:36,126 --> 01:29:38,209
I promise I'll return.

926
01:29:38,376 --> 01:29:39,293
If one gets free--

927
01:29:39,459 --> 01:29:41,126
All go home.

928
01:30:40,918 --> 01:30:43,209
Oh, what have they done to you?

929
01:30:45,084 --> 01:30:46,584
Laura.

930
01:30:46,751 --> 01:30:49,293
You've got to trust me,
this child is not evil.

931
01:30:55,459 --> 01:30:57,043
Laura.

932
01:30:57,209 --> 01:31:00,334
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Laura isn't here right now.

933
01:31:01,293 --> 01:31:02,876
No!

934
01:31:03,043 --> 01:31:05,334
Laura, I know
you're still in there.

935
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:06,918
I'm gonna get you out of here.

936
01:31:13,043 --> 01:31:13,959
Stop!

937
01:31:19,293 --> 01:31:20,209
Stop!

938
01:31:25,334 --> 01:31:26,209
Stay with me.

939
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:40,209
Laura, listen to me.

940
01:31:40,376 --> 01:31:42,293
This child is
not what you think.

941
01:31:42,459 --> 01:31:43,459
He will defeat the devil.

942
01:32:03,668 --> 01:32:06,668
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Brother...

943
01:32:06,834 --> 01:32:10,084
I have wonderful news.

944
01:32:13,209 --> 01:32:14,751
My water's broken.

945
01:32:39,751 --> 01:32:42,418
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Worship me or I'll end you.

946
01:32:42,584 --> 01:32:43,376
Never!

947
01:32:52,209 --> 01:32:57,126
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Loving me will be a moment
of clarity for you.

948
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:08,084
Even those against me
will question their judgment.

949
01:33:09,418 --> 01:33:11,501
We can rule Earth and heaven.

950
01:33:12,293 --> 01:33:15,001
We just have to kill Dad.

951
01:33:16,209 --> 01:33:20,668
He just gave me a message
for you.

952
01:33:21,376 --> 01:33:23,209
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Whisper it in my ear.

953
01:33:23,376 --> 01:33:25,376
You won't possess the baby.

954
01:33:26,126 --> 01:33:27,751
He will possess you.

955
01:33:32,084 --> 01:33:33,751
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
He will possess me?

956
01:33:43,709 --> 01:33:45,459
No!

957
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:49,126
The child will not be
my undoing.

958
01:33:49,293 --> 01:33:51,376
Can't you sense it even now?

959
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:54,501
This child is born
of eternal blood.

960
01:33:54,668 --> 01:33:56,251
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Shut up!

961
01:33:56,418 --> 01:33:58,584
He is more powerful than you.

962
01:33:58,751 --> 01:34:01,376
Because good is more powerful
than evil!

963
01:34:01,543 --> 01:34:03,043
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Motherfucker!

964
01:34:05,668 --> 01:34:07,709
Try to stop your contraction.

965
01:34:07,876 --> 01:34:10,001
You can't stop this baby
from being born.

966
01:34:10,168 --> 01:34:11,293
He wants to be born.

967
01:34:12,501 --> 01:34:14,334
To bind you like I bound you.

968
01:34:17,001 --> 01:34:19,418
You are not God's equal!

969
01:34:20,126 --> 01:34:22,959
You rule over the rebellion.
That is all.

970
01:34:23,126 --> 01:34:25,168
And in every age,
you are defeated.

971
01:34:31,709 --> 01:34:34,584
Laura! Open the door!

972
01:34:36,626 --> 01:34:37,501
No!

973
01:34:39,459 --> 01:34:40,418
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Kill it!

974
01:34:40,584 --> 01:34:41,626
I will not!

975
01:34:41,793 --> 01:34:42,584
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
Listen to me!

976
01:34:42,751 --> 01:34:44,709
No more tricks, Laura.

977
01:34:44,876 --> 01:34:45,834
Get her to the altar.

978
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:46,751
LUCIFER'S VOICE:
No.

979
01:34:46,918 --> 01:34:48,293
It's God who tricked us.

980
01:34:48,459 --> 01:34:50,126
No, no!

981
01:35:09,376 --> 01:35:12,959
Push. Keep pushing.

982
01:35:19,043 --> 01:35:20,043
Good.

983
01:35:27,168 --> 01:35:28,126
Yes, it's--

984
01:35:30,209 --> 01:35:32,918
Where are you taking my baby?

985
01:35:51,168 --> 01:35:52,626
No, no.

986
01:35:53,418 --> 01:35:54,876
No!

987
01:35:55,043 --> 01:35:56,959
No, no!

988
01:35:57,126 --> 01:35:58,084
No!

989
01:36:25,293 --> 01:36:30,209
Welcome our beautiful,
exalted prince.

990
01:36:31,084 --> 01:36:35,459
We're no longer
under the tyranny of God.

991
01:36:42,209 --> 01:36:44,168
Our lost eternal.

992
01:36:47,584 --> 01:36:48,584
Worship him.

993
01:37:01,751 --> 01:37:04,126
Lord Lucifer,...

994
01:37:06,334 --> 01:37:12,084
...I baptize you
not with water...

995
01:37:12,251 --> 01:37:13,918
...but with blood.

996
01:38:11,543 --> 01:38:12,793
Take them all!

997
01:39:24,209 --> 01:39:27,251
He found you
in your youth.

998
01:39:28,376 --> 01:39:30,501
I want to be a part of it.

999
01:39:30,668 --> 01:39:32,251
I know you do.

1000
01:39:33,584 --> 01:39:36,376
But I have something
much more precious.

1001
01:39:38,834 --> 01:39:40,626
You'll have a moment with him.

1002
01:39:57,293 --> 01:39:58,751
Check inside.

1003
01:39:58,918 --> 01:40:01,334
No one can live
to tell the story.

1004
01:40:24,251 --> 01:40:26,209
Laura. Laura!

1005
01:40:27,334 --> 01:40:28,251
Laura.

1006
01:40:30,501 --> 01:40:31,459
- Laura!
- Michael!

1007
01:40:31,626 --> 01:40:32,543
Come, come on!

1008
01:40:34,459 --> 01:40:35,751
Come on, that's it.

1009
01:40:35,918 --> 01:40:36,668
That's it.

1010
01:40:36,834 --> 01:40:38,418
Come on, that's it.

1011
01:40:38,584 --> 01:40:40,168
Where's my baby?

1012
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:49,126
Give me my baby.

1013
01:40:50,793 --> 01:40:51,459
No!

1014
01:40:52,626 --> 01:40:53,876
No, no!

1015
01:40:55,376 --> 01:40:57,543
Michael, don't harm my Lucifer.

1016
01:40:57,709 --> 01:40:59,793
The child is not Lucifer.

1017
01:40:59,959 --> 01:41:02,084
He has his own destiny.

1018
01:41:02,251 --> 01:41:04,168
Lucifer's lust for revenge
blinds him.

1019
01:41:05,501 --> 01:41:08,168
He chose the only DNA
that can imprison him.

1020
01:41:08,334 --> 01:41:10,626
Lucifer didn't choose Laura.

1021
01:41:10,793 --> 01:41:12,043
God did.

1022
01:41:12,209 --> 01:41:13,709
Come on!

1023
01:41:13,876 --> 01:41:15,334
Find Cardinal Vincini.

1024
01:41:15,501 --> 01:41:16,834
Where are you going?

1025
01:41:17,001 --> 01:41:18,126
Home.

1026
01:41:18,293 --> 01:41:19,709
But first I have
a promise to keep.

1027
01:41:23,084 --> 01:41:24,293
You're too late!

1028
01:41:24,668 --> 01:41:26,543
Hell is coming to Earth.

1029
01:41:27,501 --> 01:41:28,251
Go now!

1030
01:42:35,043 --> 01:42:36,376
Thank you, Marconi.

1031
01:42:38,668 --> 01:42:40,459
But I miss my old self.

1032
01:43:04,918 --> 01:43:06,501
The hound of heaven indeed.

1033
01:43:24,709 --> 01:43:27,126
Maybe some of you may say,
that Father,

1034
01:43:27,293 --> 01:43:30,168
how old fashioned you are
to speak about the devil

1035
01:43:30,334 --> 01:43:32,501
in the 21st century.

1036
01:43:32,668 --> 01:43:36,001
But look out.
The devil's present.

1037
01:43:37,543 --> 01:43:38,459
The devil's here.

1038
01:43:40,043 --> 01:43:42,459
Even in the 21st century.

1039
01:43:45,793 --> 01:43:47,751
