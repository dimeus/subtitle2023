Well, let's get going.

19
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,419
How's it going, JJ?

20
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:56,377
Almost there.

21
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,075
Yo, get him to open the trunk.

22
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:01,295
Jack Jack?

23
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,079
On it!

24
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,213
Turn off your truck
and step out.

25
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,214
Why?

26
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,519
National Security.

27
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:10,608
Shame on you, bastard.

28
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,610
You are helping the infidels.

29
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:15,004
Could you kindly turn off
the truck and step out?

30
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,788
Make me if you can.

31
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:17,963
Is there a problem here?

32
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:21,141
Time's up!

33
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,972
Eddie. Chow chow?

34
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:31,151
Eddie's ready. Tom?

35
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,848
Don't talk to me, talk to John.

36
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:38,070
John! Chow chow?

37
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:39,376
What's in the back
of the truck?

38
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:40,943
Jack Jack?

39
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:42,379
Fishy, John.

40
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,860
Yeah, hold tight. Comin' in.

41
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:51,736
- He says
it's empty.
- Don't fool...

42
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,174
Tell him to open it!

43
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,701
- Tell him to stop!

44
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:00,702
- Jack Jack?
- Tell him
to fuckin'--

45
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,314
Jack Jack!

46
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:05,315
Fuck!

47
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:08,275
Jack Jack!

48
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,451
Move! Move! Move!

49
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,279
Now! Move, move!

50
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:29,339
All blue
personnel to report to
communal area for 1800 hours.

51
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,820
Aircraft engine maintenance
required on runway five.

52
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,177
Thank you, bro.

53
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,138
I heard
he's a solid guy.

54
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:47,488
We'll get him ready,
huh? Jizzy?

55
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,272
Looks like
he got some fresh panties on.

56
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,405
Sergeant Kinley?

57
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,494
Steve Kersher, uh,
I'm the new ECO.
Nice to meet you.

58
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:54,930
Kersher? Pleasure.

59
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,845
Hey, JJ. Meet your new junior.

60
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,063
Hey, I'm JJ.

61
00:03:58,107 --> 00:03:59,151
Hey, what's up? Steve.

62
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,501
-Introduce him to the boys.
-Sure.

63
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:02,111
Come meet the guys.

64
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,808
-Guys. Kersher.
He's our new ECO.
- Hey, Kinley.

65
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:04,853
I got your interpreter.

66
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,246
'Sup? I'm Steve.

67
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:07,899
They all military trained?

68
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:10,554
Some more than others,
but they all
been through basic.

69
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:11,555
I need someone in shape.

70
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,079
You see that bald one
with the beard?

71
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,256
I'd bite that one.

72
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,084
Now, he speaks four languages
that are worth speaking.

73
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,826
He can be kinda tricky, though.
He won't be pushed around.

74
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,046
Some units don't like him,
you know,
they won't work with him.

75
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:26,962
All right,
have him step forward.

76
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,311
Hey, Ahmed.

77
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:29,312
Step forward.

78
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,583
Do you smoke?

79
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,150
No, not for me, sir. No.

80
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:42,238
Why you want this job?

81
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:45,197
I need the money, sir.

82
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,635
And what was your profession
before this?

83
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:49,332
Mechanic.

84
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:50,986
You good with cars?

85
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:53,554
Anything with an engine.

86
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:55,512
Oh, yeah? Well, what's...
what's this?

87
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,389
That's an engine, sir.

88
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:07,611
You patronizing me, Ahmed?

89
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,960
No. No.

90
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:13,313
I would never patronize
an officer, sir.

91
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,141
How long you been here?

92
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,795
Five years.

93
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,709
Do you like it?

94
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,190
It's a job, sir.

95
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:24,889
Well, Akhmed,
this unit specializes

96
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:27,283
in finding Taliban munitions
and explosive sites.

97
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,765
Basically, we get into trouble.

98
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,333
Sadly...

99
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:36,336
we lost our last interpreter.

100
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:38,250
Understood.

101
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:40,905
And it's "Ahmed", sir.

102
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:43,430
Oh. Yeah.

103
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:45,997
Well, it's "Sergeant",
not "sir".

104
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,132
Hey, guys, meet Ahmed,
our new interpreter.

105
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,177
- Hey. What up, bro?
- What's up, Ahmed?

106
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:54,049
Don't disappoint and turn out
to be a pain in the ass.

107
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:56,530
Not me, sir.

108
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,022
Fucking gross.

109
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,502
I'd kill for some swine.

110
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:13,851
Do you only think
about food?

111
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:15,157
And he just ate.

112
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,245
There's nothing here
a man can eat.

113
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,943
Tom, what does that eat?

114
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:21,555
What it always eats, sausage.

115
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:23,774
There's nothing wrong
with a little sausage.

116
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,602
You just keep telling
yourself that, Chow Chow.

117
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:26,995
All right, all right, children.

118
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:28,692
School time.

119
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,739
You know,
if you're looking for weapons,

120
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,175
you are not gonna
find any here.

121
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:35,307
Oh, yeah? How do you know?

122
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,224
I know what goes on
behind these doors.

123
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:40,922
Ah.

124
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,446
The Oracle doth speak.

125
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:46,362
Again, Haadee.

126
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,588
What's going on?

127
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,807
U.S. Military brother.

128
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,983
I can see that.
What do you want?

129
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,899
They are looking
for Taliban firearms.

130
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:04,075
I have nothing to do
with those murderers.

131
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,599
I believe you.

132
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,123
But they need to believe you.

133
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,386
They're going to make
their way in.

134
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,694
But they will be as quick
as it takes to confirm
your innocence.

135
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,609
And your house
will be left prettier.

136
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,959
Than the alternative.

137
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,357
All right.

138
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,160
Clear!

139
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,250
All clear.

140
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:49,860
Clear.

141
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:50,905
All clear, too.

142
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:55,823
Clear.

143
00:07:58,347 --> 00:07:59,827
The fuck is this place?

144
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,829
What's it look like?
It's a fuckin' sports bar.

145
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:06,398
What's he saying?

146
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:11,534
He says
your intel is poo-poo.

147
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:12,796
Oh, another Oracle.

148
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,975
I'm just tired
of this bullshit.

149
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,808
All right, well,
I'm gonna stay here
and have a smoke.

150
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,114
I'll see you guys at sunrise.

151
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,162
How come you know so much
about what cooks here?

152
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,776
I'm a man about town.

153
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,952
So, this is how you spend
your lazy afternoons?

154
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:40,650
You're a dark horse, Ahmed.

155
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,308
All right.

156
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,572
Let's get outta here.

157
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:52,009
Don't lick, squeeze,
or pop anything.

158
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,056
Jizzy,

159
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,232
don't touch that pipe.

160
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,843
Well, that was fun.

161
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,671
On to the next one, I guess.

162
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,479
Jackpot!

163
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,743
Fuckin' Tali HQ.
We got 'em surrounded.

164
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,353
Haadee,
pull security for a second.

165
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:35,923
What a quaint
little house on the prairie.

166
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,186
You and I
could retire here, Jizzy.

167
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:40,667
And we can adopt a labradoodle
and milk something.

168
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:46,107
What are these coordinates?
It's turning into a fuck fest.

169
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,369
Where is this intel
coming from?

170
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:49,371
Straight outta head office.

171
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,897
-What'd you wanna do, John?
-I wanna stop wasting time.

172
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,162
Anyway, we got a couple hours.

173
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:01,818
You got that barbeque,
Chow Chow?

174
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,299
What do you think?

175
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,086
Impressive.

176
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:13,221
You know, whatever they may
say about us, Ahmed,

177
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:14,701
we're not all animals,

178
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,050
apart from Chow Chow,
of course.

179
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:26,843
To Jack Jack.

180
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:27,844
To Jack Jack.

181
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:33,676
When do you think Steve
should get his first beer?

182
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:36,157
Yeah, I don't know.

183
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,985
When do you get to drink
your first beer, Steve?

184
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:39,595
Uh, whenever you say so, sir.

185
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:45,732
-Bon appetit.

186
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:47,255
Merci, mon general.

187
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,475
To the boots
I hope to fill, boys.

188
00:10:58,266 --> 00:10:59,659
How do you like
them apples, sir?

189
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,313
I love these
goddamn apples, John.

190
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:04,185
I wouldn't normally bother you
with issues like this, sir,

191
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:06,753
but you're the only one who'll
get anything done around here.

192
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:08,580
Oh, yeah? What's the problem?

193
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:10,626
We keep going out
and achieving nothing.

194
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,062
I keep putting my men
in constant danger.

195
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:16,240
It just feels like we're moving
sand around a sandbox.

196
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:18,765
I heard your needle got stuck
on this point before.

197
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:21,376
Look, you've been tasked
with finding IED factories.

198
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,291
You can get creative
in finding them, yeah?

199
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:24,292
Do it your way.

200
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,512
I don't think
you'll like my way.

201
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,993
I don't think it's important
whether I like it or not,

202
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,386
especially if I don't know
about it.

203
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,650
I really enjoyed
not having this conversation.

204
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,738
You have a good day.

205
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:41,265
I enjoyed not having
this conversation
with you also, sir.

206
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:45,835
We are waiting on you
to get back, sir.

207
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,097
ETA, 23:00.

208
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:48,925
I know, sir.

209
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:50,971
Declan?

210
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,668
John?

211
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,062
Come through for me?

212
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:59,153
I feel used by you, John.

213
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,545
You only ever want me
for my brains.

214
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,373
Oh.

215
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:03,940
It's not like you're
a generous lover.

216
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:05,507
Well, that's 'cause you never
bought me dinner first.

217
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,424
And, no,
I did not come through.

218
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:10,642
It took me years
to get these stripes

219
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,557
and I'm not peeling them off
for you.

220
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:15,604
And since you didn't have
a conversation with Vokes
I just saw you having,

221
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:19,173
it would be impossible for me
to give you this list
of unvetted targets.

222
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,309
You always play hard to get.

223
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,834
All you gotta do is chase me.

224
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,661
Aircraft engine
maintenance required

225
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:30,793
on runway six.

226
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,753
What you doin'?

227
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:37,147
-Oh. Tightening
the fan belt, sir.
-You recognize this guy?

228
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,023
Yes, I do.

229
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:44,981
All right, come with me.

230
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:56,210
That's him.
That's Faraj.

231
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:01,215
Let's do this.

232
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,936
Stay still.
Don't say a fuckin' word.

233
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,546
Oh, relax.
We're gonna go for a ride.

234
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,070
- Come on. Move.

235
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,854
Easy, easy.

236
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:33,160
-Move. Move. Go.

237
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,552
-Easy.

238
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,293
Let's go!

239
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,121
Go, go, go, go, go!

240
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,782
Say "cheese".

241
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,004
What do you want?

242
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,570
You know who we are.

243
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,185
Tell him
that this could go
one of two ways.

244
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:59,621
The money way,
or the other way.

245
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,233
This can go one of two ways,
money or...

246
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,627
You traitor.

247
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,586
You have turned your back
on your own people.

248
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,719
I know who you are.

249
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,678
You're Ali's brother.

250
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,770
I will personally kill
your entire family.

251
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:21,861
Your wife will see your death.

252
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,472
Just before
I set the dogs on her.

253
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:31,000
I will tell you nothing.

254
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:33,307
That doesn't sound
very positive.

255
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,656
He's not too keen to help.

256
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:36,179
That it?

257
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,226
Pretty much, yes.

258
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:42,229
Give him some lube.

259
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,934
Carrot.

260
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,503
Stick.

261
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:58,593
That suit
is for a hot little island
in the Caribbean.

262
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,989
The other is to buy yourself
something pretty.

263
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:10,344
What do they want to know?

264
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:11,432
He's ready.

265
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:12,563
Simple question.

266
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:16,916
Where do they build the IEDs?

267
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,180
Where is
the Taliban's main location
for making bombs?

268
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,709
It's not just one location.

269
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,667
And you know why.

270
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:34,150
But I've seen some places
where they make explosives
and stock them.

271
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:36,805
What'd he say?

272
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:37,937
He's fishing.
He wants more cash.

273
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,334
Tell him he'll get it
when we finish the job.

274
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,336
We can save a lot of time here
if we give him the cash.

275
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:48,382
Excuse me?

276
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,388
He'll get it
when we finish the job.

277
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:01,612
You'll get more
if the information is good.

278
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:04,311
If you cut
the Taliban's head off here

279
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:06,182
it will grow back
some place else.

280
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,627
Get on with it.

281
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:17,846
-The f--

282
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,891
Just in these past two days
new explosives

283
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,851
have been sent
across the country.

284
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:25,810
I was also supposed to be there
and help.

285
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:29,727
He has a lead.

286
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,472
A lot of fuckin' dogs
around here.

287
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:49,530
Hey, Eddie?

288
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,230
What did Faraj say to Ahmed?

289
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,058
He said he'd wipe out
his bloodline,

290
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,886
and murder him in front
of his wife

291
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,279
before he fed her to the dogs.

292
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,412
How do they know each other?

293
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,761
Not sure
this is common knowledge,

294
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,850
but from what I understand,

295
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,504
Ahmed used to work
in the heroin trade.

296
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,377
It's a family business.

297
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,074
They used to work
with the Taliban.

298
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,423
So then,
why is he workin' for us?

299
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,339
Because the Talis killed
his son.

300
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,478
Why the fuck didn't you
tell me this before?

301
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:26,828
It's the price
of givin' orders.

302
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,346
Don't ever override
my authority again.

303
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,658
I understood your objective.

304
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:23,885
I apologize
for my clumsy method.

305
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,932
So, we understand each other?

306
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,023
Yes, Sergeant.

307
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,119
Good work.

308
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,087
- Okay. Yeah.

309
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:55,569
Okay, buddy.

310
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,005
All right, thank you. Bye.

311
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:01,836
Sir.

312
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,622
Well,
you got your result.

313
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,623
What do you think, John?

314
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,756
There are two sites.

315
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,061
Do this one at a time.

316
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,238
Keep it quiet.

317
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,154
Well, you need any help,
I'm a phone call away,
all right?

318
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:17,330
Thank you.

319
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,506
The first IED location
is 30 clicks.

320
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,116
One hour's drive
on a straight track.

321
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,901
And then we reach a fork
in the road, and bang a left.

322
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,642
Excuse me. Sorry.

323
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:26,817
Yeah, what is it, Haadee?

324
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:28,341
When we reach the fork
in the road,

325
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:30,386
my feeling is that
the quickest route
is to turn right,

326
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,823
even though left is shorter
as the crow flies.

327
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,129
Well, quickest, why?

328
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,652
According to the map, it's not.

329
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:36,871
In the last rainfalls,

330
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,655
most of the road on the left
got washed away.

331
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,310
What do you think, Jizzy?

332
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:44,835
I guess so.
There is no intel
to confirm or deny.

333
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,402
All right, how much time
does it add to the journey?

334
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,145
About 20 minutes.

335
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,755
Thirty, tops.

336
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,194
All right. So, we got a plan.

337
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,413
Right is right.

338
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:59,154
-Push that to the highers.
-Cool.

339
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,590
-Okay, let's move out.
-All right, let's go.

340
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:23,265
Sergeant Kinley,
can you please stop
the vehicle?

341
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,440
Excuse me?

342
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,137
I need to speak
to you, Sergeant.

343
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:28,401
We don't stop
the vehicles. We keep moving.

344
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,011
I think
we have a problem.

345
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:31,578
Please stop the vehicle,
Sergeant.

346
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:34,972
Okay,
stop the truck, Jizzy.

347
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:40,848
-  All vehicles
for a tactical stop.
- Come on, guys.

348
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,110
-What is it, Ahmed?
- Three-sixty watch.

349
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:43,633
-Let's go!
-Something's wrong.

350
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,505
There's no logical reason
for Haadee

351
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:47,463
to lead us
down this route, unless...

352
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,030
Unless what?

353
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,859
...unless he's leading us
into a trap.

354
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:55,166
Well, that's
a pretty big assumption, Ahmed.

355
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,429
Deduction, not assumption.

356
00:20:58,605 --> 00:20:59,780
Now you're teachin' me English?

357
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:02,304
North side clear.

358
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,090
I've been thinking
about all the possible reasons

359
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:07,570
why he'd take this route.

360
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,529
All the answers smell bad.

361
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,574
He lied about the road
being washed out.

362
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,620
The rainfalls
didn't affect this area.

363
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,361
Haadee's been vetted.

364
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:16,797
You can say
whatever you want, Sergeant.

365
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,494
We just don't
wanna go down this road.

366
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,063
You're out of
your bounds, Ahmed.

367
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:23,107
You're here to translate.

368
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:26,285
Actually, I'm here
to interpret.

369
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,292
All right.
You wanna be right, Ahmed?

370
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,642
-Hey, Jizzy.
Check the drone.
-On it.

371
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:37,513
JJ, Tom Cat,

372
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:38,775
go up to the top
of those rocks there

373
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:39,950
-and tell me what you see.
- Copy that.

374
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:45,782
Viper 6-2, Viper 6-2,
this is Havoc 3-3.

375
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,480
Havoc 3-3,

376
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,699
-this is Viper 6-2, over.
-Roger. We need
live imagery now.

377
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,702
Why have we stopped?
The road is safe.

378
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,400
What are we waiting for, John?

379
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,576
I'm waitin' to hear if there's
a fuckin' ambush up ahead.

380
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:04,671
ETA, ten minutes.

381
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,890
Look, I haven't got
ten minutes.
We need the imagery now.

382
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:08,283
Roger that.

383
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,372
Grid to mark, 4-5.

384
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,073
JJ?

385
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,293
All clear.

386
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,251
Tom Cat?

387
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:23,516
All clear, too.

388
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,082
-It's clear.
-  6-2 for Havoc 3-3,

389
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:26,997
-we're live.
-Viper 6-2, imagery received.

390
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,782
-Havoc 3-3, out.
-  Roger.

391
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:30,436
Okay,
what do we got here?

392
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:32,263
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Ahmed, stop!
Get the fuck off!

393
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:34,004
Get the fuck off Haadee! John!

394
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,397
Get the fuck off of him, Ahmed!

395
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,225
-Put the fucking gun down!
- Hey! Hey!

396
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:38,531
Get that gun out of his throat!

397
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:41,882
He's a traitor.

398
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:43,318
I don't give a fuck what he is.

399
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,320
You take that gun
out of his throat.

400
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,977
He gave up our position.

401
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,762
Take the gun out of his throat.

402
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:05,384
I am not gonna ask you again.

403
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:01,265
He says they have his family.

404
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:05,705
John,
you're not gonna like this.

405
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,750
What is it?

406
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:08,838
We've got a problem.

407
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,798
What the fuck is it?

408
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,060
Looks like an ambush.

409
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,888
Tali kill box
eight klicks up this road.

410
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:23,244
All right,
let's turn this thing around.

411
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:25,115
-Get back to base.
-  Copy.

412
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:30,294
Get in the truck.

413
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:35,256
Pick him up.

414
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:46,833
Look what I got, Daddy.
Look what I got.

415
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:49,444
It's from Johnny's dad.

416
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,794
-Why are you going to bed
at lunchtime?

417
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:53,709
No, baby.
Time is different here,
you remember?

418
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:55,624
I'm ten hours ahead of you.
It's nighttime.

419
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,408
I miss you.

420
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:58,801
I miss you, too. All of you.

421
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,977
Hey, kids?

422
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:03,066
You let me talk to Mommy
for just a second?

423
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,677
I'll be out
in a minute.

424
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,069
-  Love you, Daddy.
-  Love you, Daddy.

425
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:08,202
I love you, too.
Have a good rest of your day.

426
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,294
-Hey, sweetheart.
-Hey, babe.

427
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:14,730
How's... how's business?

428
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:16,297
Well, it's... it's good.

429
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,647
We have bookings
for the next six weeks
and beyond.

430
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:20,344
-That's good news.
-Mm-hmm.

431
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:21,781
How are the books?

432
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:23,478
We're up on last quarter.

433
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,350
So, you're all over it.
You're all over it.

434
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:29,049
Oh, you know me,
of course I am.

435
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:31,094
Just another one
of the reasons I love you.

436
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:33,532
Well, you know how much
I love you, John.

437
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,490
-Just hurry up and get home.
- Yeah.

438
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:57,120
Are you okay?

439
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,426
Yes, yes, I'm good.

440
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:01,298
Sit, sit.

441
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:03,300
You must rest.

442
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:06,521
Do you want me
to get you something?

443
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,872
I could eat some more.

444
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,485
Leave it to me.

445
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:19,099
Did you hear
about Hadyah's son?

446
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:20,361
What happened to him?

447
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:22,798
He's joined the Taliban.

448
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:25,453
And he won't talk
to her anymore.

449
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:27,803
When I saw her she was crying.

450
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:30,763
Poor woman, first she loses
her husband, now this.

451
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:35,071
I'm worried about him, Ahmed.

452
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:38,771
What about
our Special Immigration Visas?

453
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,557
It takes time. Don't worry.

454
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:46,387
Hey.

455
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,522
I'm on it.

456
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:58,529
-Ease up 'til they get back.
-Sir?

457
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:00,444
John.

458
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:04,057
Interpreter came through, huh?

459
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,537
Just don't know
how wild he is.

460
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:08,975
Yeah, well, he still saved
eight people's lives.

461
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:10,803
Yes, he did.

462
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:12,631
So, what's your next move?

463
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,591
-Second location,
120 klicks away.
-Awesome.

464
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,159
Three hours in a Humvee should
be fun for the old back.

465
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:22,075
Well, you could give us
a couple of birds.

466
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,642
Yeah.

467
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,644
No.

468
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:29,386
Happy hunting.

469
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:34,522
Thank you, sir.

470
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,401
Why do the Talib always seem
to have their arms cache
hundred clicks from our base?

471
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:47,056
Jizzy's hemorrhoids
won't be able to take it.

472
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,101
All right, look.

473
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:49,711
This is our fourth tour here...

474
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:52,235
And what have we achieved apart
from losing Jack Jack?

475
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,977
Even if we do find shit
that goes bang...

476
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,545
You think it's gonna make
a difference or bring him back?

477
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:01,070
What's that got to do
with Jizzy's hemorrhoids?

478
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:03,638
Why are you always
talking about ass Tom Cat?

479
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:05,727
Where do you think
he got the name Tom Cat?

480
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:09,383
We're here.

481
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,169
Nothing like
a three-hour drive.

482
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:14,997
All right,
we're 120 clicks from base,

483
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,956
and 30 minutes
from air support,

484
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,480
so, uh, do a final
comms check, Tom Cat.

485
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:21,395
Roger that. Comms clear, John.

486
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:32,406
Put your fuckin' hands up now!

487
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:33,799
Get your fuckin' hands up now!

488
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:34,713
Put your hands up!

489
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,236
Get in line over here! Now!

490
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:45,332
As you can see
I'm with the U.S. Army,
we're here to conduct a search.

491
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,942
Are you the land owner?

492
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,336
Yes, the land is mine.

493
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,120
What are you looking for here?

494
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,992
We're looking for explosives.

495
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,385
Explosives?

496
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,084
This is a closed mine.
There has not been
any explosives here for years.

497
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,477
This shouldn't take long.
Thank you.

498
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,396
Are you looking
for the Taliban?

499
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,616
Yes, we're looking for Taliban.

500
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:10,574
I knew this would happen.

501
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:13,664
But you guys have come
to the wrong place.

502
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,929
Down there's
another plantation.

503
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,890
The Americans are here
at the mine.

504
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,805
The Americans
have found the mine.

505
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,459
Send the men there.

506
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:27,548
More soldiers are coming.

507
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:30,943
That's where you'll find
the people you are looking for.

508
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,032
Thank you.

509
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:34,337
We will check there next.

510
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:36,383
Welcome.

511
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,214
Something's not right.

512
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:42,215
He's lying.

513
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,437
Jizzy, hold what you got.

514
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:48,612
Secure the area.
We're moving up.

515
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:49,657
On it.

516
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,316
- Hey! Come here!

517
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,405
Move! This guy was
on his phone!

518
00:29:58,448 --> 00:29:59,754
Give me that!
Put your hands on your head!

519
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:07,849
On me.

520
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,024
Kawa, pick up the rear.

521
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:10,025
Roger.

522
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:18,947
Everybody on the floor!

523
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:20,775
-On the floor!
- Get down! Now!

524
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,664
Clear.

525
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,623
Kawa, take over watch.
Keep eyes on the road.

526
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,172
John, it's Jizzy.

527
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:12,261
We found a big weapons cache
down here.
What do you wanna do?

528
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:14,437
Secure those bodies,

529
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,091
take up a security position
and stand by.

530
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,092
Copy.

531
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:22,402
Hands behind your backs!

532
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:23,751
Get 'em on the floor!

533
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:24,883
-Don't fuckin' move!
- Get down!

534
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,058
Tom Cat, JJ, cuff 'em.

535
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,276
Kersher,
watch the fuckin' road.

536
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,311
No! No! No! No!

537
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:04,966
Tom Cat, it's John.

538
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,055
We got an IED factory.

539
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:09,536
Four Tangos.

540
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,190
We need
air support immediately.

541
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,192
We're goin' in.

542
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:16,499
Viper 6-2, Viper 6-2,
this is Havoc 3-3.

543
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:17,718
We've hit jackpot.

544
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,373
Requesting immediate QRF. Over.

545
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,332
Copy,
Havoc 3-3, assigning QRF.

546
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:24,551
Ahmed, you stay here.

547
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:26,901
We don't need a translator
for this.

548
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:40,654
Fuckin' animals.

549
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:48,096
It's Jack Jack's killer.

550
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:52,927
Fuck!

551
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,015
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

552
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:58,498
-Clear. You all right?

553
00:32:58,541 --> 00:32:59,760
Motherfucker got me
in the arm.

554
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,414
- Ahmed! We good?
- We're good.

555
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:02,458
- Fuck.
- Watch the door.

556
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:03,938
Fuck!

557
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,244
Hold on, stay there.

558
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,038
All right,
charge is set. Three minutes.

559
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:18,474
-Let's go. Move.

560
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:19,606
Move, move, move.

561
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,131
Hold, hold.

562
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:24,002
Move, move.

563
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,489
All units, we have
a three-minute burning fuse.

564
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,274
Keep that 50-K locked
on the north road.

565
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,840
Copy that.

566
00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:38,625
- Kawa, we are
on your left. Cover us--

567
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,235
Shit!

568
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,025
Eddie! Eddie!

569
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:55,250
-Eddie's down.

570
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:56,860
-  Eddie's down.
-Get 'em on their feet.

571
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:58,166
-Get up!
-Get up right now!

572
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,081
-Get up right now!
-Move!

573
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,865
We're at the top of the hill,
making our way to you.

574
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,171
Move him, move him.

575
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:04,781
I don't want
the fuckin' Taliban to see him.

576
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:08,959
Steve, Talis approaching.

577
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:11,397
-Eleven o'clock. Two SUVs.
-Contact north!
Two Taliban trucks!

578
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,399
Get in position.

579
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:15,140
-Keep your eyes on the road!
-  Copy!

580
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:16,228
Covering nine o'clock.

581
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,885
- Shit!
- Talis on
the north bridge!

582
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,235
Contact left!

583
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:24,714
On the ridge, Tom Cat!

584
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,026
Keep your eyes on the road!

585
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,810
Viper 6-2, Viper 6-2,

586
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:36,117
troops in contact.
I repeat, troops in contact!

587
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:38,337
Viper 6-2,
we are 15 minutes out.

588
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:42,036
First truck has arrived

589
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,211
at the left
at the north entrance.

590
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,049
Kersher's down.
Tom Cat, get on the gun!

591
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,531
Go! Go!
Steve is down. Over.

592
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:59,923
Hold position. Coming to you.

593
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,664
SUV inbound.
East entrance.

594
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,330
Second SUV approaching.
East entrance.

595
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:21,467
Kawa, let's move!

596
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:23,599
Following, John--

597
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:40,312
Open fire--

598
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,493
Tom Cat!

599
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:54,152
JJ's down!

600
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:57,503
Move!

601
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,209
Fuck.

602
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:09,210
Fuck!

603
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:15,912
Move!

604
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:23,659
John! John! We need a plan now!

605
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:27,054
You have an SUV coming.
We'll cover you.

606
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:28,969
Take that truck,
go to higher ground,

607
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:30,144
and take a position.

608
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,456
John,
we're fuckin' pinned!

609
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:38,500
Move. Move.

610
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:42,548
Cover me!

611
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:53,254
- Jizzy, go, go!

612
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:55,952
Ahmed, get in! Get in!

613
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,263
John, follow me.

614
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,569
Straight ahead.
We'll punch up the--

615
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:08,574
Fuck. Jizzy! Jizzy!

616
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:26,809
Control this.

617
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:28,028
Dagger 1-2.

618
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:29,508
Dagger 1-2.

619
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,771
Dagger 1-2,
this is Dagger 3-3. Come in.

620
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,952
We're out of range.

621
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,997
Dagger 1-2, Dagger 1-2,

622
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,564
this is Dagger 3-3. Come in.

623
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:43,565
Fuck!

624
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,655
Ah, shit!

625
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:47,613
We've got a flat.

626
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:52,922
All right,
we have to abandon ship.

627
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:02,628
Ahmed. Ahmed.

628
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,688
We've found their car,
they're on foot.

629
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:23,257
I will send everyone,
go after them and kill them.

630
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,476
I want them alive.

631
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:26,826
Get them alive.

632
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:29,219
Spread out, find them.

633
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:06,039
Havoc actual.
Havoc actual.

634
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:07,214
Roger.

635
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:09,216
This is Viper 6-2.

636
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:11,914
We have approximately
40 KIA Taliban.

637
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,481
We recovered all 3-3 bodies,

638
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:15,875
minus John Kinley
and the interpreter. Over.

639
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,584
I think we're good
for now.

640
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:42,831
We'll rest here for the night.

641
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:30,400
Here's the challenge.

642
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:32,577
The satnav says
the beer is 120 clicks

643
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,796
in that direction
over shit terrain.

644
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,407
And Taliban are everywhere,
so we can't use the roads.

645
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:40,367
They will be on us
in two minutes.

646
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,238
We're not walking,
we're double-timing. You good?

647
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,502
I'm good.

648
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:08,613
They're on us.

649
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,571
Gun up?

650
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:12,138
-Gun's up.

651
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:13,269
Let's move.

652
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,321
Where's your fuckin' gun?

653
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:07,541
Halfway up the hill.

654
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:11,371
This belongs to you now.

655
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:12,807
Just don't lose it.

656
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:14,853
You ready?

657
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:16,115
Following you, boss.

658
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:37,283
Rifle.

659
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:41,896
Let's go.

660
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:00,279
Hey.

661
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:02,324
Is he dead?

662
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:04,849
Yeah.

663
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:08,069
Get him up.

664
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:13,211
It fuckin' stinks in there.

665
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:19,608
We'll rack up here
for the night.

666
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:23,438
Listen my brothers.

667
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:26,572
You will find them.

668
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:29,836
God is with you,
not the infidels.

669
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:34,319
They are the enemy
of our prophet.

670
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:37,975
They are a long way
from their base.

671
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:42,718
They will never get home.

672
00:49:42,762 --> 00:49:45,112
It is your duty
to bring them to justice.

673
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:48,986
I want them brought
to me alive.

674
00:50:38,774 --> 00:50:39,862
They see a house.

675
00:50:43,649 --> 00:50:45,042
We haven't seen too many
of those.

676
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,223
If we can hear them,

677
00:50:53,702 --> 00:50:54,964
they gotta be close.

678
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:00,579
Pack up your shit.

679
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:52,457
Ahmed.

680
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:37,023
Stop him

681
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:39,852
I must kill him.

682
00:52:39,895 --> 00:52:40,853
Calm down brother.

683
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:41,810
He must die.

684
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:43,072
We need him alive.

685
00:52:43,116 --> 00:52:44,030
Calm down.

686
00:52:44,073 --> 00:52:45,336
Calm?

687
00:54:46,935 --> 00:54:47,936
Hey.

688
00:54:53,072 --> 00:54:53,986
John.

689
00:54:55,727 --> 00:54:56,684
We're going home.

690
00:54:59,557 --> 00:55:00,775
It's gonna be a long journey.

691
00:55:03,604 --> 00:55:04,953
We can't take the roads.

692
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,435
They know we're here.

693
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:13,658
More men will be coming here
in trucks.

694
00:56:44,966 --> 00:56:45,793
Here you go.

695
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:48,465
We've broken down,
we need a ride.

696
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:50,597
Okay, I will take you
anywhere you want.

697
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,385
Drive a few kilometers
up this road.

698
00:57:56,429 --> 00:57:57,735
Okay, I will take you.

699
00:58:00,346 --> 00:58:02,087
What are you doing
out here brother?

700
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:06,178
Looking for two men,
an American and the other,
a Muslim traitor.

701
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:07,701
Have you seen
anyone suspicious?

702
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:11,096
I have seen no one,
these roads are quiet.

703
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:13,664
I am surprised to see even you.

704
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:16,362
We will find them,
this is our territory.

705
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:20,366
What's in the back?

706
00:58:20,975 --> 00:58:23,064
I'm a rug seller.

707
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:24,457
Are you interested?

708
00:58:25,632 --> 00:58:26,546
Just drive.

709
00:58:38,471 --> 00:58:39,646
Stop the truck.

710
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,604
Stop the truck.

711
00:58:45,434 --> 00:58:46,653
Thank you.

712
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:49,264
Peace be upon you.

713
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,372
Peace be upon you.

714
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,248
Hello brother, how are you?

715
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:18,511
Good thank you.

716
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,992
I apologize
for disturbing your meal.

717
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,255
Sit.

718
00:59:23,951 --> 00:59:24,952
Thank you.

719
00:59:27,215 --> 00:59:29,000
Did you hunt those?

720
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:32,569
You shall feast tonight.

721
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:40,533
Brother, I have a friend
in the truck, he's hurt.

722
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,144
How can I help?

723
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:46,713
We need some food
and some pain relief.

724
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:50,761
And if you give me
your wooden kart...

725
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,851
I will give you my truck.

726
00:59:57,332 --> 00:59:58,725
May I see your friend?

727
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:00,988
Of course.

728
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:17,004
So you're the two
they are looking for.

729
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:22,183
I don't like Taliban.

730
01:00:22,227 --> 01:00:24,142
I will help you.

731
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:25,839
He needs opium.

732
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,321
It will ease his pain.

733
01:00:31,149 --> 01:00:32,019
Thank you.

734
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,937
There's a heavy price
on your heads.

735
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:39,810
They have hundreds of Taliban
looking for you.

736
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:41,725
They have been
village to village,

737
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:44,989
setting fire to those
that give no information.

738
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:47,469
They will not stop hunting you.

739
01:00:48,514 --> 01:00:51,473
You are a long way
from his base.

740
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:55,086
Do not use the roads,
patrols are everywhere.

741
01:00:56,217 --> 01:00:58,742
You must use
the mountain passes.

742
01:04:54,803 --> 01:04:57,154
Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you.

743
01:05:01,462 --> 01:05:02,420
Would you like something?

744
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,553
Give me the water.

745
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:09,993
Thank you.

746
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,895
Peace be upon you.

747
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,201
Peace be upon you.

748
01:05:46,203 --> 01:05:47,117
Hello brother.

749
01:05:48,814 --> 01:05:49,946
Give me water.

750
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:53,036
Hey, catch.

751
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:22,516
Put your fucking hands up!

752
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,561
Hands up!

753
01:07:23,604 --> 01:07:24,736
Get down on the ground!

754
01:07:26,825 --> 01:07:28,305
Get down on the ground!

755
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:29,567
Get the fuck down!

756
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:30,524
Get down!

757
01:07:31,308 --> 01:07:32,265
Stay down!

758
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:34,224
Look away!

759
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:37,314
I have one of yours.

760
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:39,620
-He's in the cart.
-Check the cart.

761
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:47,672
It's John fuckin' Kinley.

762
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:50,240
Hey! Hey,
it's John fuckin' Kinley.
We need a medic over here!

763
01:08:11,217 --> 01:08:13,306
Dr. Kale, please dial 1-1-8.

764
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:18,355
We're going home.

765
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:21,271
We're going home.

766
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:23,447
We're going home.

767
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:27,277
Dr. Kale, please dial 1-1-8.

768
01:08:36,721 --> 01:08:38,636
Welcome home, Mr. Kinley.

769
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:40,377
-I'll get your doctor.

770
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:01,746
Heard they're
giving you a medal,

771
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:04,923
Distinguished Service Cross.

772
01:09:04,966 --> 01:09:06,359
- Come on,
put it away, guys.
-That was quick.

773
01:09:06,403 --> 01:09:08,448
- Dinner's in five.
- Well,

774
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:10,058
you did crawl
on your hands and knees

775
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:11,799
over broken glass
for a 100 clicks, so...

776
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:15,238
If I did,
I don't remember any of it.

777
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:19,372
You still don't remember
a thing?

778
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:21,548
I mean, I remember waking up
in the hospital.

779
01:09:21,592 --> 01:09:24,334
So, why should they
give me a medal?
They should give it to him.

780
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:28,947
As far as I know,
I was just a passenger.

781
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,602
I don't think
it's a medal he wants
as much as a visa he needs.

782
01:09:34,561 --> 01:09:36,476
Well, what's goin' on
with that?

783
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,087
Well, even if we can get
the visa,
we still gotta find him first.

784
01:09:39,131 --> 01:09:40,045
Find him?

785
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:44,919
Where'd he go?

786
01:09:44,963 --> 01:09:46,878
Well, after your little hike
in Afghanistan,

787
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:49,489
Ahmed found himself
a local folk hero

788
01:09:49,533 --> 01:09:51,622
to everyone, but the Taliban.

789
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,972
Let's just say,
they're not pleased
he dragged you 100 clicks

790
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:57,149
across their territory,
and they were unable
to catch you.

791
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,673
Your story has developed
something of a following
among the populous.

792
01:10:00,457 --> 01:10:02,285
What's that look like?

793
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:03,895
He ended up
on their top ten
most-wanted list

794
01:10:03,938 --> 01:10:06,245
with a price on his head.

795
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:07,725
Disappeared and went
underground with his family.

796
01:10:17,474 --> 01:10:19,302
Before you ask,

797
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:21,260
I reached out
to his smack-dealing brother.

798
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:24,045
I sense he knows where he is,

799
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:26,657
but he's not gonna give us
that information
until we get Ahmed a visa.

800
01:10:28,485 --> 01:10:33,098
Ahmed. Ahmed Abdullah.

801
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:34,491
And how are you
spelling that, sir?

802
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:35,840
Yeah, A-B-D...

803
01:10:35,883 --> 01:10:37,276
Yes, I know, ma'am. I...

804
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,625
Has his visa been approved?

805
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:40,888
Mr. Abdullah was... was set
to have his visa issued.

806
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:42,673
And the name, sir?
-Ahmed.

807
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:44,109
Your friend needs to fill out

808
01:10:44,152 --> 01:10:45,806
-an I-360 form.
-I-I can't get him
on the phone.

809
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,765
His... his family have
been forced into hiding.

810
01:10:47,808 --> 01:10:49,462
-Ma'am, I've explained
this situation to...
-  Just one minute.

811
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:52,117
-...your supervisor already.
Can you not...
-Just one minute.

812
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,510
-Just gonna put you
on hold, sir.
-Can you...

813
01:10:53,553 --> 01:10:55,903
How are you supposed to do
a background check

814
01:10:55,947 --> 01:10:57,862
on a three-month-old child?

815
01:10:57,905 --> 01:11:01,953
Can you not put me on hold?
I have been holding
for one and a half hours.

816
01:11:01,996 --> 01:11:03,171
Just one minute.

817
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:22,582
Well, first we have to
figure out how to make sure
their visas are issued,

818
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:24,323
and then I can figure out
how to find them.

819
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:27,283
Would you leave your wife
and child behind? Would you?

820
01:11:28,936 --> 01:11:31,069
He disappeared and went
underground with his family.

821
01:11:31,112 --> 01:11:33,114
He disappeared and went
underground with his family,

822
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:34,246
because of you.

823
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,943
-Because of you.

824
01:11:35,987 --> 01:11:37,380
I just gave you
all that information.

825
01:11:37,423 --> 01:11:39,207
I literally just gave that
to your supervisor.

826
01:11:39,251 --> 01:11:40,383
No, I'm not related.

827
01:11:40,426 --> 01:11:41,862
He's in Afghanistan...

828
01:11:41,906 --> 01:11:43,081
Just
gonna put you on hold, sir.

829
01:11:43,124 --> 01:11:44,561
-Fuckin' hold music!

830
01:11:44,604 --> 01:11:46,084
You leave people on hold
for an hour and a half,

831
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:47,215
they're gonna get frustrated.

832
01:11:50,044 --> 01:11:51,481
Yes, ma'am. Yeah.

833
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:53,178
Yes, I have
the letter right here.

834
01:11:53,221 --> 01:11:54,179
From Colonel Masters?
-That's correct.

835
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:55,441
Yeah.
It's from Colonel Masters.

836
01:11:55,485 --> 01:11:56,790
Okay, so yeah, well then
how long will that be?

837
01:11:56,834 --> 01:11:58,139
It's a minimum
nine months, sir.

838
01:11:58,183 --> 01:12:00,838
They...
they can't wait nine months!

839
01:12:00,881 --> 01:12:02,709
If they wait nine months,
they will be dead!

840
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:09,586
-Good night, boss.
-Hey, I'll lock up, Miguel.

841
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:11,457
I'll lock up.

842
01:12:11,501 --> 01:12:12,719
You're through to USCIS,

843
01:12:12,763 --> 01:12:14,330
-how can I help you, sir?
-Uh...

844
01:12:16,114 --> 01:12:18,072
Are you gonna put me
on hold again?

845
01:12:18,116 --> 01:12:19,596
-Yeah, go ahead
and put me on hold again.
-If you could just bear

846
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:20,945
with me for one minute, sir.

847
01:12:20,988 --> 01:12:22,555
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

848
01:12:22,599 --> 01:12:24,122
Don't put the phone down.

849
01:12:24,165 --> 01:12:24,862
-Don't put
the fucking phone down.
-It will just take

850
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:26,820
one moment, Sergeant.

851
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:27,821
-I will find someone
that can help you.
-You put... You fucking put me

852
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:29,997
on hold again,
and I will find you.

853
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:33,523
Put me on hold! Come on!

854
01:12:33,566 --> 01:12:36,177
What's
your fucking name, huh?

855
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:38,049
What's your name?

856
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:41,531
I will come
to your fuckin' house,
and I will find you!

857
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:46,753
There's a fuckin' man stuck
in a goddamn cave!

858
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:48,233
I will find you!

859
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,131
Drink this.

860
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:31,624
You're okay.

861
01:14:39,518 --> 01:14:40,345
Hey.

862
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:43,653
Quiet.

863
01:15:15,598 --> 01:15:16,686
John?

864
01:15:21,212 --> 01:15:22,213
John.

865
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:33,659
As if it wasn't enough
for him to carry me
across those mountains,

866
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:35,531
now I can't get him
out of my fuckin' head.

867
01:15:45,758 --> 01:15:47,499
I'm lying in this bed.

868
01:15:50,937 --> 01:15:53,157
I kiss my children
before they go to school.

869
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:57,074
And he's hiding
in a hole somewhere.

870
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,426
A hole he can never get out of.

871
01:16:01,469 --> 01:16:03,471
A hole that we put him in.

872
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:09,956
And that wasn't the deal.

873
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,003
The deal was that we offered
his family sanctuary.

874
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:16,615
Then we tied a noose
around his neck

875
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:18,443
and we kicked the stool
out from under him.

876
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:28,758
I should be
in that hole.

877
01:16:38,071 --> 01:16:39,638
You think he blessed you?

878
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,122
Well, he fuckin' cursed me.

879
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:55,567
I am a man who gets no rest.

880
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,490
Please continue to hold.

881
01:17:05,533 --> 01:17:07,100
Your call is in a queue.

882
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:11,409
Please continue to hold.

883
01:17:11,452 --> 01:17:12,410
Your call is in a...

884
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,807
We both know
how this is gonna end.

885
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,074
I am gonna have
to get him out myself.

886
01:17:27,512 --> 01:17:28,513
I know a guy.

887
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,691
Parker.
Private security contractor.

888
01:17:35,128 --> 01:17:37,653
I hear he's very good,
and he can help you.

889
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,613
But it's gonna cost.

890
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,920
We'll have to give you
a different name
and background.

891
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:47,314
If the Talibs find out that
you're back in the country,
they'll know why.

892
01:17:47,358 --> 01:17:49,360
And they'll throw everything
they have at finding you both.

893
01:18:20,478 --> 01:18:21,522
Hello.

894
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:24,525
Taliban are here.

895
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:27,920
Where?

896
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:29,661
They are a few doors down.

897
01:18:30,618 --> 01:18:33,186
-Get out of there.
-Basira.

898
01:18:34,187 --> 01:18:36,189
I will have to move you again.

899
01:18:36,973 --> 01:18:38,583
Leave now.

900
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:39,715
Yes, I know, I know.

901
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,935
Basira the bag, the bag.

902
01:18:43,457 --> 01:18:44,284
Let's go.

903
01:18:49,072 --> 01:18:50,769
They've executed Abdi.

904
01:18:56,557 --> 01:18:57,907
Your house is next.

905
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,343
Let's go, let's go.

906
01:19:01,562 --> 01:19:03,173
Taliban heading towards you.

907
01:19:03,216 --> 01:19:04,217
Wait, wait.

908
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:05,392
-Where, where?

909
01:19:05,436 --> 01:19:06,611
He's approaching
the back entrance.

910
01:19:06,654 --> 01:19:07,786
Wait.

911
01:19:11,485 --> 01:19:13,009
He's twenty feet
from the door.

912
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:20,494
Twelve feet.

913
01:19:41,124 --> 01:19:43,779
Three Taliban heading
towards your front door.

914
01:19:52,396 --> 01:19:53,919
The back door is clear.

915
01:19:58,663 --> 01:20:00,273
They're in your house.

916
01:20:01,884 --> 01:20:03,711
Out the back, turn right.

917
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:05,844
I see you.

918
01:20:11,719 --> 01:20:13,330
Get down,
more Taliban are here.

919
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:22,600
Move, now.

920
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,105
- Mornin', boss.
-Mornin'.

921
01:20:50,715 --> 01:20:52,151
I could only find three
of these.

922
01:20:54,284 --> 01:20:55,720
I swear there's two more
around here.

923
01:20:55,763 --> 01:20:57,504
All right.

924
01:20:57,548 --> 01:20:59,898
So, you know where
to find us
if there's a problem.

925
01:20:59,942 --> 01:21:01,421
- Great. Thank you.
-Pleasure doing business
with you.

926
01:21:01,465 --> 01:21:02,553
Bye.

927
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:05,251
Mr. Kinley.

928
01:21:06,296 --> 01:21:07,558
Mrs. Kinley.

929
01:21:15,218 --> 01:21:16,784
Looks like you've
got everything under control.

930
01:21:17,394 --> 01:21:18,917
Mm-hmm.

931
01:21:18,961 --> 01:21:21,093
The Cadillac will be ready
this afternoon.

932
01:21:21,137 --> 01:21:24,053
and the Harleys will be
picked up at six o'clock.

933
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:28,709
Guess you don't
need me then.

934
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:30,711
Nope.

935
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:31,974
But you sure look purty.

936
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:36,848
I'm gonna go...

937
01:21:38,981 --> 01:21:40,373
put on something sexy.

938
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:24,591
I know and have accepted
what you do, John.

939
01:22:26,506 --> 01:22:28,639
We've had this conversation
many times.

940
01:22:31,903 --> 01:22:33,557
I've said goodbye to you,

941
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,429
not knowing
if I'm going to see you again.

942
01:22:36,473 --> 01:22:40,303
And I've been doing this
for 12 years.

943
01:22:41,608 --> 01:22:42,958
But this time, it's different.

944
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:50,313
This family believed
that you were dead.

945
01:22:52,271 --> 01:22:55,535
We suffered this news
for three weeks.

946
01:22:57,842 --> 01:22:59,931
Do you know what the children
and I went through?

947
01:23:02,455 --> 01:23:04,762
But you have put me
in an impossible position.

948
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:07,808
Being your wife is one thing,

949
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:10,855
but being their mother,
it's... it's something else.

950
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,990
We owe that man your life.

951
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:22,954
So, we will remortgage
the house,

952
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,217
you'll get those visas,

953
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:27,002
and you will go.

954
01:23:28,046 --> 01:23:29,395
And you will do
what you have to.

955
01:23:32,442 --> 01:23:33,530
You'll come back alive.

956
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:38,752
You'll come back alive,
John Kinley.

957
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:01,210
Colonel. Declan.

958
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:02,646
John, please, have a seat.

959
01:24:06,867 --> 01:24:08,043
Everything all right, John?

960
01:24:10,915 --> 01:24:12,177
No, everything's not all right.

961
01:24:13,004 --> 01:24:14,005
Have a seat.

962
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,876
I'd rather stand,
if you don't mind.

963
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:25,886
So, you seem
to have been making
a lot of noise lately.

964
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,367
What's your fucking name? Huh?

965
01:24:28,411 --> 01:24:31,109
-  Sergeant, there is no--
-  What's your name?

966
01:24:31,153 --> 01:24:32,676
-  It's First Officer
Cowell.
-  I will come

967
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,025
to your fucking house,

968
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,896
and I will find you!

969
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:37,724
Sergeant,
please calm down.

970
01:24:37,768 --> 01:24:41,424
There's
a fucking man stuck
in a goddamn cave!

971
01:24:41,467 --> 01:24:43,991
Sir, I assure you,
we're doing everything we can.

972
01:24:44,035 --> 01:24:45,558
Fuckin' hole and...

973
01:24:48,648 --> 01:24:50,563
There's been a,
uh, official complaint.

974
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:53,653
Oh, I see.

975
01:24:53,697 --> 01:24:55,873
You brought me here
for an intervention.

976
01:24:57,701 --> 01:24:59,485
Or to slap my wrist.

977
01:25:01,357 --> 01:25:02,445
That's not why I'm here.

978
01:25:04,882 --> 01:25:08,799
You think if I could be shot
of this debt, I wouldn't be?

979
01:25:10,975 --> 01:25:15,936
Do you think if I could just
go through the usual channels,
I wouldn't?

980
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:21,594
That is not how
this debt works.

981
01:25:24,771 --> 01:25:28,471
It demands a result,
not an appeasement.

982
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:36,696
There is a hook in me.

983
01:25:40,483 --> 01:25:42,093
One that you cannot see.

984
01:25:45,531 --> 01:25:46,532
But it is there.

985
01:25:51,798 --> 01:25:53,452
And you think I have a choice?

986
01:25:56,542 --> 01:25:57,891
There is no fuckin' choice.

987
01:26:00,067 --> 01:26:03,419
I am going to get that man
and his family

988
01:26:03,462 --> 01:26:06,683
out of the position
that we put him in.

989
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:11,514
And of that, I have no doubt.

990
01:26:15,082 --> 01:26:16,301
And you're gonna
help me, Colonel.

991
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:23,047
The reason that I am here...

992
01:26:29,271 --> 01:26:30,968
I saved your life
eight years ago.

993
01:26:33,797 --> 01:26:35,233
So you're gonna
get those visas.

994
01:26:35,886 --> 01:26:37,235
I don't know how.

995
01:26:38,584 --> 01:26:39,846
But you're gonna get them.

996
01:26:42,936 --> 01:26:45,548
Because I know
you are the type of man

997
01:26:47,245 --> 01:26:48,290
that pays his debts.

998
01:26:55,122 --> 01:26:56,036
Pay your debts.

999
01:27:22,454 --> 01:27:23,542
I love you both so much.

1000
01:27:23,586 --> 01:27:24,891
I'm gonna
miss you, Daddy.

1001
01:27:24,935 --> 01:27:25,979
I'm gonna miss you.

1002
01:27:26,023 --> 01:27:27,024
I'll miss you, too.

1003
01:27:28,547 --> 01:27:29,461
Okay.

1004
01:27:35,337 --> 01:27:36,512
We are gonna miss you, John.

1005
01:27:38,209 --> 01:27:40,559
I know. I'll be back in a week.

1006
01:27:43,301 --> 01:27:44,215
Come here.

1007
01:27:47,349 --> 01:27:48,175
Kiss me.

1008
01:28:18,554 --> 01:28:20,207
Ron Kay? Vokes' man?

1009
01:28:20,251 --> 01:28:21,208
Parker, yeah?

1010
01:28:21,252 --> 01:28:22,384
-Yeah.
-I hear good things.

1011
01:28:25,561 --> 01:28:26,953
So, we set?

1012
01:28:26,997 --> 01:28:30,609
Well, I've contacted
Ahmed's brother, Ali.

1013
01:28:30,653 --> 01:28:33,264
He says he's found the village
that Ahmed's at,

1014
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,832
but he's had
no contact directly yet.

1015
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:36,833
So, we're goin' to the brother?

1016
01:28:38,878 --> 01:28:40,227
Yeah, well, that was the plan.

1017
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:43,318
Was?

1018
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:45,320
We've been pulled away
to do another job.

1019
01:28:45,363 --> 01:28:46,625
We have a contract, Parker.

1020
01:28:46,669 --> 01:28:48,323
We have an agreement.

1021
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:49,454
And I need you to honor it.

1022
01:28:49,498 --> 01:28:50,629
This outranks me.

1023
01:28:50,673 --> 01:28:53,066
It comes from the top.

1024
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:55,895
We got a UN diplomat,
got his detail in hot water,

1025
01:28:55,939 --> 01:28:57,593
we gotta deal with it.
That's all there is to it.

1026
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:03,468
Listen, you hold up here
for three days,

1027
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:05,470
my team's all yours.

1028
01:29:05,514 --> 01:29:07,211
That's not how
this contract works, brother.

1029
01:29:09,213 --> 01:29:12,303
In three days,
a warm body turns cold.

1030
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:16,002
And I know
it's not ten million dollars,
but you said, "Yes."

1031
01:29:16,046 --> 01:29:19,354
And I'm two pints of blood
and a 150k in the hole.

1032
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:21,965
Well, Ron, if you're not happy,
you can take your money back.

1033
01:29:22,008 --> 01:29:23,662
Oh, no, I'm definitely
not fuckin' happy.

1034
01:29:26,099 --> 01:29:27,144
I don't want the money.

1035
01:29:29,015 --> 01:29:32,236
I want you
to honor the fuckin' deal.

1036
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,370
I hear you have
an impressive team.

1037
01:29:36,414 --> 01:29:37,633
Now I need you
to back yourself.

1038
01:29:42,942 --> 01:29:43,987
All right, listen.

1039
01:29:44,683 --> 01:29:45,641
Let's, uh...

1040
01:29:46,903 --> 01:29:48,948
compromise, shall we?

1041
01:29:48,992 --> 01:29:52,778
If you can find Ahmed
and his family,

1042
01:29:52,822 --> 01:29:55,302
call us with the location,
we'll come in,

1043
01:29:55,346 --> 01:29:56,782
airlift you out,
get you back to base,

1044
01:29:56,826 --> 01:29:58,741
put you
on the next transport home.

1045
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,829
Done.

1046
01:30:01,004 --> 01:30:02,005
You just gotta find him.

1047
01:30:02,048 --> 01:30:03,136
I see how this works.

1048
01:30:05,182 --> 01:30:08,141
I pay you
so I can wash the car.

1049
01:30:08,185 --> 01:30:10,492
Come on, man.
You know how to adapt.

1050
01:30:10,535 --> 01:30:12,885
Use what you got,
and this is what you got.

1051
01:30:12,929 --> 01:30:16,541
Now, you can wait three days,
you get the full magazine.

1052
01:30:16,585 --> 01:30:20,545
Or you can go now,
but you're goin' solo.

1053
01:30:20,589 --> 01:30:24,027
I'll set you up.
I'll give you four good wheels
and a full set of tools,

1054
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:26,551
but you're gonna be alone.

1055
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:32,427
There's $10,000 cash
and a sat phone.

1056
01:30:33,776 --> 01:30:36,431
You got an M-4 in the trunk,
with six magazines.

1057
01:30:44,308 --> 01:30:46,266
You got a full tank of gas,

1058
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:48,355
satnav address
that's gonna take you to Ali.

1059
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:49,705
You can touch base
with him first.

1060
01:30:51,794 --> 01:30:53,360
Ron, it's 72 hours.

1061
01:30:55,362 --> 01:30:56,320
If I was you, I'd wait.

1062
01:30:57,974 --> 01:30:59,454
Yeah, but you're not me.

1063
01:31:00,846 --> 01:31:01,804
Are you, Parker?

1064
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,525
Ali,
are you accepting customers?

1065
01:32:11,569 --> 01:32:13,092
John!
John, come in.

1066
01:32:18,576 --> 01:32:20,186
Sit down, please.
Please sit down.

1067
01:32:20,883 --> 01:32:21,884
Relax.

1068
01:32:25,452 --> 01:32:26,497
Just a second.

1069
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:32,895
Hassan!

1070
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:37,160
You want some tea?

1071
01:32:42,644 --> 01:32:45,472
Do you know
what John means in my country?

1072
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:51,130
My dear. My love.

1073
01:32:52,741 --> 01:32:55,570
My brother told me about
your beautiful blue eyes.

1074
01:32:59,138 --> 01:33:00,749
You have beautiful blue eyes.

1075
01:33:02,054 --> 01:33:04,796
Ahmed's son also
had beautiful blue eyes.

1076
01:33:08,017 --> 01:33:08,931
Cigarette?

1077
01:33:33,129 --> 01:33:35,653
The only reason
I haven't been tortured

1078
01:33:37,046 --> 01:33:38,438
about the location
of my brother,

1079
01:33:38,482 --> 01:33:42,921
is because I do a lot
of business with the Taliban.

1080
01:33:42,965 --> 01:33:45,097
I guess you know what
I'm doing for a living, right?

1081
01:33:47,404 --> 01:33:48,666
Yeah, I think I understand.

1082
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:51,756
Hmm.

1083
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:58,284
You also understand my brother
has become very unpopular
with my partners.

1084
01:33:58,328 --> 01:34:03,420
They don't like the fact
that the story of your rescue
has become so famous.

1085
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:06,205
Well, that's why I'm here. I...

1086
01:34:07,293 --> 01:34:09,295
I feel bad about that.

1087
01:34:09,339 --> 01:34:10,645
I owe your brother my life.

1088
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:16,041
If you can give me
the location of your brother

1089
01:34:16,085 --> 01:34:17,695
I can get him
out of the country.

1090
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,135
Is that your truck there?

1091
01:34:23,179 --> 01:34:25,398
You can't take that.
It's too dangerous.

1092
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,097
I organized some transport.

1093
01:34:29,402 --> 01:34:32,536
There's my truck driver,
his name is Pooya.

1094
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:35,365
He has a pass
to get him through
the Taliban checkpoints.

1095
01:34:35,408 --> 01:34:38,934
However, sometimes,
they can be still difficult.

1096
01:34:40,805 --> 01:34:42,546
When was the last time
you talked to your brother?

1097
01:34:42,589 --> 01:34:44,243
A week ago.

1098
01:34:46,115 --> 01:34:47,638
And he's due
to move in two days.

1099
01:34:48,508 --> 01:34:50,467
But this is his last chance.

1100
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:52,208
The price on his head
is too great now.

1101
01:35:02,784 --> 01:35:03,915
Good luck, John Kinley.

1102
01:35:04,524 --> 01:35:05,917
Goodbye.

1103
01:35:43,302 --> 01:35:44,739
Stay hidden. Stay hidden!

1104
01:35:51,006 --> 01:35:52,050
Show us the papers.

1105
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:56,620
-Make it quick.

1106
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,464
It's okay.

1107
01:36:31,611 --> 01:36:33,091
Checkpoint! Checkpoint!

1108
01:36:42,231 --> 01:36:43,406
Hello brothers.

1109
01:36:44,886 --> 01:36:46,975
Turn off the engine.

1110
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:53,633
-Step out.
-What's the problem?

1111
01:36:53,677 --> 01:36:54,983
-I said step out.
-I paid for this.

1112
01:36:55,026 --> 01:36:55,940
Step out.

1113
01:36:55,984 --> 01:36:57,202
But, I paid for this.

1114
01:37:00,466 --> 01:37:01,424
What's in your truck?

1115
01:37:01,467 --> 01:37:02,381
I paid for this.

1116
01:37:02,425 --> 01:37:03,774
I said what's in your truck?

1117
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,515
Corn boxes, I have brought them
for your brothers.

1118
01:37:05,558 --> 01:37:06,908
-Delivering, where to?
-Jalalabad.

1119
01:37:06,951 --> 01:37:07,778
So show us.

1120
01:37:12,217 --> 01:37:13,262
Open this too.

1121
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:16,308
-You see.
-Be quiet son of a dog.

1122
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,487
There is nothing.

1123
01:37:21,531 --> 01:37:22,749
Be quiet son of a dog.

1124
01:37:31,367 --> 01:37:32,585
Take this money.

1125
01:37:32,629 --> 01:37:34,544
I do not care about your money.

1126
01:37:34,587 --> 01:37:36,328
I do not care about your money.

1127
01:37:37,503 --> 01:37:38,591
Who are you to pay me?

1128
01:37:39,418 --> 01:37:40,637
On your knees.

1129
01:37:56,305 --> 01:37:57,784
You good?

1130
01:37:57,828 --> 01:37:58,916
I thought we were dead.

1131
01:38:03,225 --> 01:38:04,182
Let's get him outta here.

1132
01:38:14,410 --> 01:38:15,933
Do you hear, Commander Satar?

1133
01:38:15,977 --> 01:38:17,108
Fakhrudin?

1134
01:38:17,152 --> 01:38:18,718
We have trouble.

1135
01:38:18,762 --> 01:38:22,070
Two men have killed
our soldiers at the checkpoint.

1136
01:38:22,113 --> 01:38:23,810
Find out who they are.

1137
01:38:23,854 --> 01:38:24,899
I'll follow them.

1138
01:38:24,942 --> 01:38:26,117
Keep in contact.

1139
01:38:48,096 --> 01:38:49,271
John?

1140
01:38:49,314 --> 01:38:50,359
John, it's Vokes.

1141
01:38:51,012 --> 01:38:51,926
I got the visas.

1142
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:54,624
Whole family.

1143
01:38:55,755 --> 01:38:57,279
I'm having them delivered
to Parker.

1144
01:38:59,498 --> 01:39:00,891
-Good man.
-John.

1145
01:39:02,414 --> 01:39:03,415
Good luck, brother.

1146
01:39:19,127 --> 01:39:20,084
We are here.

1147
01:39:29,572 --> 01:39:31,226
Red 6, this is Red 1,

1148
01:39:31,269 --> 01:39:32,531
got you Lima Charlie...

1149
01:39:32,575 --> 01:39:33,706
Ron for Parker.

1150
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:36,231
Boss, it's for you.
It's Ron Kay.

1151
01:39:38,102 --> 01:39:39,538
-Red 6, good copy.
-Ron.

1152
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:41,323
Result?

1153
01:39:41,366 --> 01:39:42,411
Parker, I found him.

1154
01:39:43,499 --> 01:39:44,979
Tracking your location now.

1155
01:39:45,675 --> 01:39:46,850
You make contact?

1156
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:48,678
No.

1157
01:39:48,721 --> 01:39:50,854
But I am looking at him
right now.

1158
01:39:50,897 --> 01:39:52,899
Uh, got his location now, sir.

1159
01:39:53,726 --> 01:39:55,032
All right, we got you.

1160
01:39:55,772 --> 01:39:57,252
Yeah, just wait a second.

1161
01:40:00,472 --> 01:40:04,650
Nearest extraction point
is Darunta Dam,

1162
01:40:04,694 --> 01:40:08,002
two kilometers due east
from where you stand now.

1163
01:40:08,045 --> 01:40:10,743
-Darunta Dam. Got it.
-All right, call us back

1164
01:40:10,787 --> 01:40:13,572
when you got your man,
his family,
and you're en route.

1165
01:40:13,616 --> 01:40:15,879
You'll have a two-hour window
from that point, all right?

1166
01:40:15,922 --> 01:40:19,143
Uh, yeah, one more thing,
Parker, um...

1167
01:40:19,187 --> 01:40:22,059
We don't have much time.
I left a messy trail.

1168
01:40:22,103 --> 01:40:23,495
All right, we'll make a call.

1169
01:40:23,539 --> 01:40:24,888
See if we can get some eyes up.

1170
01:40:25,584 --> 01:40:26,672
Go get your boy.

1171
01:40:55,397 --> 01:40:56,659
A lot of dogs around here.

1172
01:41:29,561 --> 01:41:30,475
I like your outfit.

1173
01:41:31,998 --> 01:41:33,391
And I like what you've done
with your hair.

1174
01:41:55,457 --> 01:41:58,329
Must've been quite challenging
to find me.

1175
01:42:00,331 --> 01:42:01,289
Eh.

1176
01:42:06,468 --> 01:42:10,036
I can get you
and your family outta here.

1177
01:42:11,081 --> 01:42:12,691
We just have to leave now.

1178
01:42:13,388 --> 01:42:14,215
Now?

1179
01:42:20,786 --> 01:42:22,571
That's a shame.

1180
01:42:26,618 --> 01:42:27,663
I like it here.

1181
01:42:32,189 --> 01:42:34,626
Mmm.

1182
01:42:36,802 --> 01:42:38,761
Mmm. I can see why. Yes.

1183
01:42:50,555 --> 01:42:52,296
Fakhrudin.

1184
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,471
What is it?

1185
01:42:53,515 --> 01:42:55,038
I found them.

1186
01:42:55,081 --> 01:42:56,605
The American and Ahmed.

1187
01:42:56,648 --> 01:42:58,868
Are you sure it's them?

1188
01:42:58,911 --> 01:43:00,522
I'm positive.

1189
01:43:00,565 --> 01:43:01,914
He's found John Kinley
and Ahmed.

1190
01:43:01,958 --> 01:43:03,394
Get men out there now.

1191
01:43:03,438 --> 01:43:06,180
Follow them right now
and get their picture.

1192
01:43:06,223 --> 01:43:07,181
Yeah, what is it, Joe?

1193
01:43:07,572 --> 01:43:08,704
Ron Kay.

1194
01:43:08,747 --> 01:43:09,879
What about him?

1195
01:43:09,922 --> 01:43:10,923
Yeah, I thought
he looked familiar,

1196
01:43:10,967 --> 01:43:12,577
but I couldn't
put my finger on it.

1197
01:43:12,621 --> 01:43:15,363
So, I ran him through
the system and our intel shows

1198
01:43:15,406 --> 01:43:17,843
he's on the Talib's
most-wanted list.

1199
01:43:18,453 --> 01:43:19,454
He's on a list?

1200
01:43:20,846 --> 01:43:22,196
Why is he on a list?

1201
01:43:24,589 --> 01:43:26,852
Oh, fuck me.

1202
01:43:26,896 --> 01:43:29,855
"Ron Kay", that...
that's John Kinley.

1203
01:43:29,899 --> 01:43:31,509
Why didn't he
tell us that before?

1204
01:43:31,553 --> 01:43:33,903
It's John Kinley
and Ahmed.

1205
01:43:33,946 --> 01:43:36,210
I think if John Kinley
is popular with the Talib,

1206
01:43:37,559 --> 01:43:39,648
then Ahmed is the fattest
fuckin' pig in the pen.

1207
01:43:40,692 --> 01:43:42,564
Let's turn this thing around.

1208
01:43:42,607 --> 01:43:45,784
-Cody, get Bagram
on the line, now!
- Yes, sir.

1209
01:43:45,828 --> 01:43:48,744
They're gonna want in on this,
and we wanna get
an  Angel in the air.

1210
01:43:48,787 --> 01:43:51,225
-You two, get the drone footage
up right now.
- On it!

1211
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:52,791
At last,

1212
01:43:53,836 --> 01:43:55,272
gonna get my boots dirty.

1213
01:43:59,145 --> 01:44:00,234
Basira.

1214
01:44:03,585 --> 01:44:04,847
Basira, this is John.

1215
01:44:05,543 --> 01:44:06,544
John?

1216
01:44:15,466 --> 01:44:17,903
Ahmed, what's going on?

1217
01:44:17,947 --> 01:44:19,601
John has got us visas.

1218
01:44:20,341 --> 01:44:21,733
We are going to America.

1219
01:44:27,086 --> 01:44:28,131
We have to go now.

1220
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:43,581
Where are they?

1221
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:46,236
I have someone watching them.

1222
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,324
I'll take you there.

1223
01:45:17,136 --> 01:45:17,963
Let's go.

1224
01:45:34,066 --> 01:45:37,287
They are in the truck
heading towards the dam.

1225
01:45:43,206 --> 01:45:45,948
They are heading
towards the dam.

1226
01:45:45,991 --> 01:45:47,950
Fakhrudin, listen to me
very carefully.

1227
01:45:47,993 --> 01:45:49,952
Do not let them get away,

1228
01:45:49,995 --> 01:45:52,041
I want their heads
or else I'll take yours.

1229
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:14,455
I can see the dam.

1230
01:46:22,158 --> 01:46:23,202
Taliban trucks!

1231
01:46:23,899 --> 01:46:25,030
Taliban trucks!

1232
01:46:45,877 --> 01:46:46,922
Pooya, block the tunnel.

1233
01:47:33,751 --> 01:47:35,187
- Move!

1234
01:47:42,673 --> 01:47:44,022
Come on!

1235
01:47:44,066 --> 01:47:45,807
Move, move, move,
move, move!
