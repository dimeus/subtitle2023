00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,041
[chattering on radio]

2
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,208
[alarm blares]

3
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,333
[announcer on PA] Attention,
all dome personnel and residents.

4
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:52,208
Due to the meteor shower warning,
the lockdown will start in seven minutes.

5
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:56,125
Please return to your living quarters
and remain there until further notice.

6
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,791
I repeat,
the lockdown will start in seven minutes.

7
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,333
[teen 1] How much longer?
The lockdown's about to start.

8
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,791
[teen 2] Oh, thanks. We didn't hear
the super loud announcement.

9
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,250
[teen 3] Is that supposed to be blinking?

10
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,916
[teen 1] You guys are bad at being bad.

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,083
-[teen 2] Hey, you could help, you know?
-[teen 1] I got us in here. Doing my part.

12
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,708
[teen 2]
Could you at least hand me that wrench?

13
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,333
Seriously, guys. Why is this blinking?

14
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,791
Probably because we're stealing it.

15
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,041
Why don't you say that a little louder in
case the microphones didn't pick that up?

16
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't worry, genius.
They don't have microphones down here.

17
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,125
Seriously, you don't have to wear that.

18
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,708
Says you.
They probably have facial ID scans.

19
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,875
Borney, it's a garage, not a food vault.

20
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,708
[teen 2] And you look like an idiot.

21
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,750
Yeah, well, my brother told me once,

22
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,625
this kid, he got caught
messing around down here,

23
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,875
and then they put him in a holding cell
out by the terra complex

24
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,750
and left him there for 60 years.

25
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,541
-You're doing it again.
-Doing what?

26
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,625
You're catastrophizing.

27
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,791
-Okay, that's not even a word.
-Of course it's a word.

28
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,166
-[teen 1] It's totally a word.
-[door opens]

29
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,250
What was that?

30
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,291
[door closes]

31
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,458
Everybody, hide.

32
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,625
[whispers] Go, quick, quick.

33
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,291
[grunts, sighs]

34
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,125
[worker 1] Where is everybody?

35
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,625
[worker 2] They're in lockdown like
we were supposed to be 30 minutes ago.

36
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,791
[worker 1] Okay, okay.

37
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,000
[door closes]

38
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,083
We're clear.

39
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,416
Don't tell me I'm catastrophizing.

40
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,375
Dylan, it's almost lockdown.
What is taking so long?

41
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,958
[Borney] Catastrophizing. [scoffs]

42
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,833
[Dylan grunts] What's your personal record
for hot-wiring a rover, huh?

43
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,791
[grunting]

44
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,708
[engine whirs]

45
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,208
-[Dylan laughs]
-Whoa!

46
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,416
[Dylan] Yes!

47
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,000
How'd you like that, huh?

48
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:43,083
[alarm blaring]

49
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,166
-You said there wouldn't be alarms.
-Yeah, on the doors.

50
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,250
-What do you mean--
-I told you, but nobody listens to me!

51
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,291
We're gonna spend
the rest of our lives in a tiny cell!

52
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,416
Do something! Turn it off.

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,791
Oh, yeah. Let me get right on that
for you. I don't know how!

54
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,333
-What do you mean you don't know how?
-[teen 1] You're the one who did it!

55
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,666
[Dylan] Your dad's on the science team.
Just do something!

56
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,041
[door opens]

57
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,041
You must be Caleb.
My name is Maria Slater.

58
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,875
Sorry to keep you waiting.

59
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:18,666
{\an8}We've only got a few more hours until
the lockdown, so things are a bit chaotic.

60
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,833
Would you like some chocolate?

61
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:30,000
It's real. Just arrived
on the cargo shuttle this morning.

62
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:37,958
Caleb, are you aware of the death benefits
included in your father's contract?

63
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,958
Yes, ma'am.

64
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,500
It said if he died working in the mines,

65
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:47,916
then any family he had here with him
would get to go to Omega.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,375
That's right.

67
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,500
It's important that you understand

68
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,250
how much we all appreciate
your father's service.

69
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,916
I can only imagine
how devastating this must be.

70
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,000
I understand that you also
lost your mother a few years back.

71
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,083
Seven.

72
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,416
She died seven years ago.

73
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:17,583
The journey to Omega,
as you probably are aware, is 75 years.

74
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:21,625
You, of course, will be in cryosleep
for the duration of the trip.

75
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:26,375
Once you arrive, it'll be like waking
from a long, peaceful nap,

76
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,625
exactly the same age you are now.

77
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,750
Do I have to go? Can't I just stay here?

78
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,708
I'm afraid that is not an option.

79
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,958
I understand that you probably
will miss your friends.

80
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,916
I'll never see them again.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,791
By the time I wake up,
they'll be old or dead.

82
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,416
You will make new friends on Omega.

83
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,250
Caleb, your parents sacrificed
a great deal to give you this opportunity.

84
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,333
People who come here
and work in the mines,

85
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,583
they spend years
fueling the transports to Omega,

86
00:05:55,666 --> 00:06:00,166
all so that their families,
their children, can be on them.

87
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,583
Now, the meteor shower warning
will be in effect for the next 72 hours.

88
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,500
Once the lockdown is lifted,
and we have the all-clear,

89
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,541
you will be on a transport
and on your way.

90
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,333
I thought the next transport didn't leave
for another two months.

91
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,333
Scheduling is always a bit fluid.

92
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,166
I know it may not seem like it right now,

93
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,291
but this really is the start
of something special for you.

94
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,166
[workers chattering]

95
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,166
[grunts, pants]

96
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,333
[Michael] Come on, Caleb. You can do it.

97
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,166
Don't be scared.

98
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,375
What if I fall?

99
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,208
Geez.

100
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,291
That'd be pretty messy, wouldn't it?

101
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,083
We can go back down if you want.

102
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,500
We don't have to do this.

103
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,958
But if we do, you gotta get up there
on your own.

104
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,125
-You understand why?
-Yeah.

105
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,250
You wanna go down?

106
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,291
-[sighs] No.
-Good man.

107
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,625
Go on then. Let's do this.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,875
[Michael]
You see that little star right there?

109
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,583
Just off the edge of that cluster.

110
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,416
-You see it?
-Yeah.

111
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,958
[Michael] They say it burned out
over a hundred years ago.

112
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,250
But it was so far away, the last
of its light hasn't reached us yet.

113
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,958
Your mom used to say
it's like a memory traveling through time.

114
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,666
We'd sit up here, and she'd say
life was just like that star.

115
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:19,291
And all the memories we have, all
the people we love, the places we've been,

116
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,708
that's the light we see,
even though the star is gone.

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You were born here, raised here.

118
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,625
This dome is the only world
you've ever known.

119
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,666
So many memories you never got to have.

120
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,291
We're gonna fix that someday.

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
How?

122
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:49,166
Well, there's a place me and your mom
used to sneak away back to

123
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,833
before you were born,
just off past the eastern ridge.

124
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,875
It's the only place up here
she really loved.

125
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,541
Right there.

126
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,458
What's so special about it?

127
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:08,083
You'll see. When you're a little older,
you and me are gonna take a road trip.

128
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,500
A what?

129
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,625
[chuckles]
Something we used to do back on Earth.

130
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,041
No better way to travel
when you gotta get somewhere.

131
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,375
-Hey.
-[Caleb] Hey.

132
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,208
Figured I might find you up here.

133
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,458
How'd things go with Ms. Slater?

134
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,958
They're putting me on a transport
in three days.

135
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,750
As soon as the lockdown's over.

136
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,875
We could still do it.

137
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,166
No, it's fine. We don't have to--

138
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,250
Hey. Whatever's out there,
your dad wanted you to see it.

139
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,583
We're doing this.

140
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,666
-Just thought we'd have more time.
-Me too.

141
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,541
[Borney panting]

142
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,916
Marcus, this is too high.
Why do they always have to go up so high?

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,916
-[Marcus] You're almost there.
-Here he is.

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,333
Hey, did you get your pills?

145
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,916
[Marcus] Yeah, I got my pills.

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,875
Why are you always bothering me
about my pills?

147
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,791
Because you've got a heart
the size of an asteroid, that's why.

148
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:19,125
[Marcus] Yeah? Well, you've got the mouth
the size of a black hole. [chuckles]

149
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,208
[Borney] Good one.

150
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,250
-Hey, guys.
-[Dylan] Hey.

151
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,583
[groans] Hey, how about from now on,
we do this a little lower to the ground?

152
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,166
-[Marcus] Hey.
-That sounds pretty good to me.

153
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,833
-[Marcus] How'd things go with Ms. Slayer?
-[Borney] That lady scares me.

154
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,333
[Marcus] Yeah, that lady scares everybody.

155
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,416
[Borney] My brother told me
this kid talked back to her,

156
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,875
and then he disappeared for two days.

157
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,416
A-And when they found him again,

158
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,750
he said he couldn't remember
a single thing that happened.

159
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,791
[chuckles]

160
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,958
You realize not a thing
you just said is true, right?

161
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,166
Yeah, well, what do you know?

162
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,625
My brother's a genius.
He knows these things.

163
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,583
Seriously, what was she like?

164
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,833
She gave me chocolate.

165
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,583
Like, actual, real chocolate?

166
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,250
Man, real chocolate.

167
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,416
I can't even remember
the last time I had chocolate.

168
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,166
W-Wait a second. What's going on?

169
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,666
What's wrong with you guys?

170
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,458
He's leaving in three days.

171
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,750
What?

172
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,750
But-- But the next transport
didn't leave for another two months.

173
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,000
They're sending one
as soon as the lockdown's over.

174
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:23,375
So, we're still leaving, though, right?

175
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,625
Are you kidding me?

176
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,125
We're leaving tonight.

177
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,250
[Borney] Are you guys sure we're ready?

178
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,250
[sighs] With what we added today,
I think we have enough.

179
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,208
Hey, can you imagine what they'll do to us
if they find out we stole this much stuff?

180
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,666
-I can.
-We're gonna need more oxygen.

181
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,708
They're definitely gonna notice
if we take more.

182
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,291
Yeah, but they won't notice
before tonight.

183
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,125
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You guys, I got a crack-smacker.

184
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,541
-A what?
-You know, for cracks.

185
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,708
-Do you mean a sealant pen?
-Yeah, if you wanna be all technical.

186
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,166
[knocking]

187
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,000
Hey, quick. Quick, cover this up.

188
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,750
-Wait, wait, wait.
-[Borney] Marcus, hey, help me hide this.

189
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,083
[keypad beeps]

190
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,541
Caleb Channing?

191
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,250
Yes, sir.

192
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,833
[messenger] Your father's ashes.

193
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,458
Sorry for your loss.

194
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,833
That was depressing.

195
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,791
[laughing]

196
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,541
-[Dylan] You okay?
-[Caleb] Yeah.

197
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,708
[Dylan] You sure?

198
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,916
You're all right, buddy.

199
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:53,041
I'm just saying, the whole point
of a lockdown is so you don't leave.

200
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,625
Yeah, that's why tonight's perfect.

201
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,125
Once we get clear of the perimeter,
they can't come after us.

202
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,083
-It's like an insurance thing.
-But there's a meteor shower warning.

203
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,666
Yeah. They issue those warnings
all the time.

204
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,750
Have you ever actually seen
a meteor shower?

205
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,000
That's a dumb question. How could I?

206
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,583
We've never even been outside before.

207
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,333
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

208
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,708
Of course I'm coming.

209
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,875
What about you? You sure you can do this?

210
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,833
He's gotta bring his pills.

211
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,666
Dude,
will you knock it off with the pills?

212
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,458
Stop worrying.
It's not good for you. Thank you.

213
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,208
If I don't worry, who's gonna worry?

214
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,416
I wanna go outside.

215
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,041
That settles it then.

216
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,125
Hey.

217
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,250
We don't have the access codes
into the garage.

218
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,458
How are we gonna get out?

219
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,541
I got an idea about that. [chuckles]

220
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,541
[Borney] Addison Weaver. That's your idea?

221
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,500
Don't stare.
Yes, that's my idea. It's perfect.

222
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,250
She just came up from Earth,
like, a couple of months ago.

223
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,875
Doesn't have any friends.

224
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,291
[whispers] I hear she's weird.

225
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,500
[Dylan sighs] Well, I can handle that.

226
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,583
Plus, her dad's on the science team.

227
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,958
So she has all codes
to all subbasement garages.

228
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,541
I don't know, man. Like you said,
she doesn't have any friends.

229
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,541
So we're just gonna be all nice
to get the codes?

230
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
[Dylan] All right, look.

231
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,750
We can all do something really nice
for her when we get back, okay?

232
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,541
Right now, this is the only way
we get to do this.

233
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,250
[Borney sighs]

234
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,333
All right.

235
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,750
[Dylan clears throat]

236
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,625
{\an8}[sighs]

237
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,791
Hi.

238
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:39,958
Can I help you?

239
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,458
My name's Dylan.

240
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,875
-Cool name.
-[chuckles] Thanks.

241
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,708
You know, I saw you sitting over here,
and I thought you--

242
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,416
Hey-- Hey, wait! Hold on.

243
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,416
-Hey, come on. [grunts]
-Hey, watch it.

244
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:58,958
[Dylan] Addison, wait.

245
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,458
[sighs]
I don't think it's going very well.

246
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,000
[Dylan] Just hold on. Wait.

247
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,833
-Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
-What?

248
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,083
-Just--
-I know the way you guys think about me.

249
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,041
I'm just
a spoiled little Earth girl, right?

250
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,708
The only time that anyone here talks to me
is whenever they want something.

251
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,041
So whatever it is, the answer's no.

252
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,375
Okay. First of all, you don't know
why I came over here.

253
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,208
Maybe I came over here
because I feel bad no one talks to you.

254
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,458
Okay, great. Are we done?

255
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,708
Okay, okay. Just hold on.

256
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,500
Hey, can you hear me out?

257
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,583
-Please?
-What?

258
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:35,291
Look, my best friend is about to leave.
Like forever. Okay?

259
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,833
His dad was the miner
that got killed last week.

260
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,208
I'm sorry. I didn't--

261
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,625
I didn't know.

262
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,791
[chattering]

263
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,791
Bet she tells Ms. Slayer on us.
Then we're really in for it.

264
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,708
You need to be more positive, man.

265
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,708
Oh, I'm plenty positive.
Positive she's gonna tell on us.

266
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,750
Are you trying to freak everyone out?

267
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,208
[Borney] But why would she help us?

268
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,291
[sighs]

269
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,625
So what do you need the codes for?

270
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:07,125
Uh, we need to borrow
one of the long-range rovers.

271
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,291
Why?

272
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,708
'Cause we gotta go somewhere.

273
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,791
-Where do you have to go?
-That's not important.

274
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,500
Well, it is if you want the codes.

275
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay.

276
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,708
There's a crater
about a day's ride from here.

277
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,000
It's in the eighth quadrant.

278
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,666
Nobody's supposed to go out there.
Not even the miners go out there.

279
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,375
Look, all we need from you are the codes
to get the rover and to get outside.

280
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,125
I still don't get exactly
why you're doing this.

281
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,333
I told you already, okay?
His dad wanted him to--

282
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,333
Yeah, yeah. No, I get why he's doing it.

283
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:37,916
Why are you?

284
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,208
'Cause he's my friend.

285
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,125
Yeah. Okay, fine.

286
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,916
-Yeah, I'll get you the codes.
-Really?

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,416
-Under one condition.
-Yeah, yeah. Anything.

288
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,625
-She what?
-She wants to come, okay?

289
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,708
Why?

290
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,833
I don't know. She said it's the only way
she'll give us the codes.

291
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,083
This is a bad idea. No.

292
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,958
-No, this is, like, the worst idea ever.
-Why?

293
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,291
-[whispers] Because she's from Earth.
-[Dylan] So?

294
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,875
Earth people have different ways.
They're-- They're peculiar.

295
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,500
You're peculiar.

296
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,000
Let's give her a shot, man.

297
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,875
But she doesn't know how we do stuff.

298
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:28,708
Okay, look. She's not gonna give us
the codes unless we let her come, right?

299
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,791
Pretty much.

300
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,958
-Then we vote. All in favor?
-Yeah.

301
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,416
-It's gotta be unanimous, Borney.
-Borney, put your stupid hand in.

302
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,916
[groans]

303
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,125
-Thank you. Now let me win this one.
-[Borney] Hey, not fair.

304
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,666
-[Caleb] Nope. Nope. Uh-huh.
-Come on, guys!

305
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,291
-Nope.
-[Marcus] You're gonna knock my drink.

306
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,416
-What are you doing?
-You guys done?

307
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Oh.

308
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,958
So, what's it gonna be?

309
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,541
Let's go steal a rover.

310
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,375
[Addison] Let me get right on that!
I don't know how to turn it off!

311
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,500
[Borney] See, I told you! What did I say?
I said this was a bad idea!

312
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,208
[Dylan] Borney, you're not helping!
So why don't you just--

313
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,833
Yeah! Yeah, that'll work.

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,083
[alarm blares]

315
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:20,458
[announcer on PA] Attention. Attention,
all dome personnel and residents.

316
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,541
[panting]

317
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:27,791
Mandatory lockdown of all dome facilities
will commence in T-minus three minutes.

318
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,166
We should go.

319
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,458
Yeah, you think?

320
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,458
[Caleb] Oxygen looks good.

321
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,458
-[Marcus] Okay. This-- This is good.
-All right.

322
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,750
-[Borney] Marcus?
-[Marcus] I got it.

323
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,333
Are you sure you know
how to drive this thing?

324
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,500
You kidding?
These things basically drive themselves.

325
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,125
[engine cranks, sputters]

326
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,375
I got it. I got it.

327
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,916
[engine starts]

328
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,583
Go punch in the code to the door.

329
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,416
So you guys can drive off without me?
No, thanks.

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,416
I got it. What's the code?

331
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,916
Ten, 28, 58.

332
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,250
Ten, 28, 58. Got it.

333
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,041
[door hisses]

334
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,166
[Dylan] Hey, what's that?

335
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,416
[Addison] Just a little something
from Earth. It's a tradition.

336
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,458
You said it was a road trip. Right?

337
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,416
-Okay.
-[Marcus scoffs] Earth people.

338
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,708
[announcer on PA]
Attention, all personnel.

339
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,875
Mandatory lockdown
will commence in T-minus one minute.

340
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,333
You know the best thing about road trips?

341
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,541
You get to leave everything behind.

342
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,875
[alarm blaring]

343
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,250
[Michael]
No matter what's happened before.

344
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,375
Whatever mistakes you might have made.

345
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,375
Whatever dreams you might've lost.

346
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,708
Whoever you're supposed to be

347
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,708
or whatever the world
has tried to make you.

348
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,500
Let's go. [sighs]

349
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,250
[Michael] Because now you're deciding.
You're the one choosing the path.

350
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:57,875
And the most important thing to remember,
it's not just about where you're going.

351
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,541
It's about how you get there,
the people you get there with.

352
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,166
You're never quite the same when
you finish as you were when you began.

353
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,625
In that magical space between where
you've been and where you're going…

354
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
you're free.

355
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,291
You're the master of your own fate.

356
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,291
[Caleb] We did it. We're actually outside.

357
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,625
[Borney] Whoa. Look at that.

358
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,166
It just goes on and on forever.

359
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,583
-You okay, man?
-Yeah.

360
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,833
[Borney] Oh, man.
This is gonna be so cool.

361
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,833
We're like-- like adventurers now, like--
Uh, what's the word?

362
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,583
Masters of our own fate.

363
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,875
[Borney chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, I like that.

364
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,666
Masters of our own fate.

365
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,125
-You guys ready to see the moon?
-[Caleb] Yeah.

366
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,833
-Whoo!
-[laughing]

367
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,708
-Whoo!
-Let's do this!

368
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,541
We're gonna visit all these places.
We're all gonna hang out.

369
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,083
Gonna be so-- Gonna be so fun.

370
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,333
-[Marcus] Let me grab the wheel.
-[Borney] Gonna be so fun.

371
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,458
[Dylan] Let's do this!

372
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,625
-What does this one do?
-[chuckling] No, no, no. Not those.

373
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,583
[Marcus] Is this one… This one stops the--

374
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,833
We are on track.
We've been driving for, like, two hours.

375
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:05,791
So we have about ten more hours to go.

376
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,125
[imitates gunshots]

377
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,416
[both scream]

378
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,875
-Hey! Not funny!
-[Marcus chuckling]

379
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,875
-[Marcus] Get off of me! Get off of me!
-Hat. Give me the hat!

380
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,541
-Stop!
-[laughs]

381
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,416
-[Borney] Hey!
-[Marcus laughs] Look at you. Look at you.

382
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,291
-[Marcus] Oh, my God.
-[Borney] This looks better.

383
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,250
[Marcus]
Addison, does it look better? Seriously.

384
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,541
[Dylan] Is that the transport?

385
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,625
Yeah.

386
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,125
[alarm beeping]

387
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,375
[Borney] Time for your pills.

388
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,458
[beeping stops]

389
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:49,125
-What are those for?
-He's got a giant heart. Like huge.

390
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,166
The doctors think he'll probably die
in a few years.

391
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,166
-Dude.
-What? They do.

392
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,791
But he won't because he takes his pills.
So, he's fine.

393
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,958
-Well, that's good then.
-[Borney] Hey. [sighs]

394
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,083
Will you hold on a second?
You gotta drink water.

395
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,250
-Otherwise, you'll cough the whole time.
-[slurps]

396
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,291
Hey.

397
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,333
Hey, guys-- Guys, guys, check that out.

398
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
[Borney chuckles]

399
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,916
[Dylan chuckles]

400
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,583
I've never seen anything like that before.

401
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,166
-[Addison] Whoa.
-[Borney chuckles] Whoa.

402
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,083
[Addison chuckles]

403
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,833
I wonder what it was supposed to be?

404
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,875
My dad used to talk
about places like that.

405
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:34,375
He said back a long time ago
when they first came up from Earth

406
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:35,833
and started building here,

407
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,458
the moon was gonna be this big deal.

408
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,125
Like a paradise.

409
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:43,250
The kinda place people on Earth
only dreamed about.

410
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,500
But once they found Omega,
everything just stopped.

411
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:49,375
Now there's all this stuff out here
that never got finished.

412
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,458
Can you imagine
if they'd finished building it?

413
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:06,416
[Addison] Yeah.

414
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,750
That'd be really cool.

415
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,000
[Borney]
Are the buildings on Earth that big?

416
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,458
[Addison] Yeah, most of them are bigger.

417
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,625
Wow. Hey, what else is different?

418
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:25,083
-Between the Earth and the moon?
-Yeah.

419
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,708
Let's see. There's, uh--

420
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:31,208
There's trees that have leaves
that change color in the fall.

421
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,458
Uh…

422
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:35,791
Water. You don't have television.

423
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,625
Haven't seen a book since I landed.

424
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:41,833
You don't really have music,
rain, snow, wind, weather.

425
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,208
I mean, don't they teach you guys
this stuff in school?

426
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,250
[Dylan, Caleb chuckling]

427
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:50,125
Mmm, no. No, see, school is
where they teach us how to mine helium,

428
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,875
how to deal with low gravity in the mines,

429
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:55,125
uh, mining helium, and how to handle
helium once it's been mined.

430
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,375
All so a bunch of rich people
can have enough fuel

431
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:58,833
for their transports to get to Omega.

432
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:01,208
I mean, it's a really great program. Yeah.

433
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,375
Well, if that's true,
then how do you know so much about Earth?

434
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,000
Because my dad grew up there.

435
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,625
So? Didn't all of your parents
grow up on Earth?

436
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,875
[Dylan] Not mine.
My grandparents did though.

437
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:16,541
-Uh, Borney over there, his--
-Great-grandparents.

438
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,375
Yeah. Right. Marcus…

439
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,583
Marcus, how long's your family
been on the rock?

440
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,708
A long time.

441
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,416
Well, that doesn't even make any sense.

442
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,125
It's a 20-year contract.

443
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:31,208
You work in the mines for 20 years,
then you get to take your family to Omega.

444
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,625
[Caleb] That's what they tell you.

445
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,958
What they don't tell you is
every time you're late for a shift…

446
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,041
Or you get a cold…

447
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,208
Or delay production in any way…

448
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,333
[Caleb] They add more and more time
to your contract.

449
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:44,208
When my old man started in the mines,
he had six years to work off from his dad

450
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,041
before he could even start his own 20.

451
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,166
The whole thing's a giant scam.

452
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,291
I'm sorry. I didn't--

453
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,416
I didn't realize.

454
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:05,250
Is the sky really blue?

455
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,750
What?

456
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,166
The sky, um, on Earth,
uh, is it really blue?

457
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,375
Yeah.

458
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,416
During the daytime. Blue as can be.

459
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:28,041
-[Marcus sighs]
-[Borney chuckles]

460
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,250
Wow.

461
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,375
Caleb, what's in the crater?

462
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,458
I don't know.

463
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,750
Whenever my dad talked about it,

464
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:56,208
all he really said was how important
it was to my mom that I see it.

465
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:04,458
There was one time he said something
about a brook that splits in two.

466
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,291
A brook? Inside the crater?

467
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,500
[Caleb] He was probably just confused.

468
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:13,458
-I-I bet there's treasure there.
-You think there's treasure everywhere.

469
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:16,958
But there is! My brother told me
that the first settlers who came here

470
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,541
brought all sorts of treasure with them.

471
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:21,166
Then, they hid it in all these places
in the middle of nowhere.

472
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,375
If there was any treasure,
they would have packed it up

473
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,041
and put it on a ship to Omega years ago.

474
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:28,250
You don't know. When I find treasure,
I'm not letting you have any of it.

475
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,041
And you're gonna get all sad and say,

476
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,875
"Aw, geez, Borney.
Can I please have some treasure?"

477
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,625
And I'm just gonna say, "Sorry, Dylan.

478
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:37,208
You're just gonna have to put more faith
in me next time,

479
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,625
and then maybe, maybe,
I'll give you some of my next treasure."

480
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,583
If you say treasure one more time,
you're going out the rover without a suit.

481
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,750
T-rea-sure.

482
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,416
-That's it. You're going outside.
-[Caleb] Whoa.

483
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,208
-Hey, hey, hey.
-[Borney chuckles]

484
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,791
[Caleb] Speaking of going outside,

485
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,750
you guys ready to have some real fun?

486
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,750
[air hissing]

487
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,500
[Marcus] Thanks.

488
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,291
-Okay, you ready?
-Yeah.

489
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,541
-[Borney] All right. You're all set.
-Thanks, Borney.

490
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:16,208
[Borney] Wow,
your suit's a lot nicer than ours.

491
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,833
My dad got it for me.

492
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,000
So, who wants to do the honors?

493
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,375
Marcus, you should go first.

494
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,416
-Yeah.
-[Dylan] Yeah, man. Definitely.

495
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Okay.

496
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,291
[Dylan chuckles]

497
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:43,375
[Marcus] Okay.

498
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:05,541
[Marcus sighs]

499
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:12,083
[breathes shakily]

500
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:18,833
[Dylan chuckles]

501
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,250

[chuckles]

503
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,208
[Borney] Whoa. Whoa.

504
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,333
[Borney chuckles]

505
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,458
[Caleb chuckles]

506
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:42,583

508
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,083

509
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:53,416
[Dylan laughs]

510
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,666
Hey, Caleb. Caleb, look!

511
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,166
-[laughs]
-[Caleb] Whoa. [chuckles]

512
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,833
This is awesome.

513
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,208
-[Marcus laughing]
-[Dylan] Whoo!

514
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,208
-[Borney] Look.
-[Marcus] Whoa.

515
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,708
[Dylan] I'm, like, so high! [laughs]

516
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:08,791
-Whoa.
-[laughing]

517
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,625
[Borney] Whoa.

518
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:15,916
[Dylan] Yeah! Whoo! [laughs]

519
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,333
Bet you don't get anything like this
on Earth, huh?

520
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,666
[Dylan] This is amazing! [laughs]

521
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,208
[Borney] Wow, look at that.

522
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:29,833
Is that Earth?

523
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,500
-Hey, Addison, which part did you live on?
-Dude.

524
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:36,791
What?

525
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:41,458
You know what?

526
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,250
We're gonna do something fun. [chuckles]

527
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,750
Tied at the bottom of the ninth,

528
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,666
two outs and a loaded count,

529
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,375
Tollefson is at the plate.

530
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,500
Weaver will try to close out
what has been an electrifying game seven.

531
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,208
[gasps]

532
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:09,375
This is it, ladies and gents,
and the home crowd knows it!

533
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,625
Oh, you can hear them chanting,

534
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,666
"Weaver, Weaver, Weaver, Weaver, Weaver."

535
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,333
-What is she doing?
-No idea.

536
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:19,666
[imitates crowd cheering]

537
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,333
Here it is, the wind up.

538
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,041
[Addison grunts]

539
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,333
-[metal clinks]
-[Marcus grunts]

540
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,500
[Addison chuckles]
Tollefson hits a doozy towards the center!

541
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,583
[Marcus laughs]

542
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:36,708
-[Addison] You gotta catch it!
-It's flying into space.

543
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,333
[scoffs] Well, run the bases.

544
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,333
-The what?
-[Dylan sighs]

545
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:45,291
This is seriously
one of the most popular games on Earth?

546
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:48,666
Hmm, yeah. With gravity.

547
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,250
-[Caleb] Seriously?
-[Dylan chuckles]

548
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,333
The moon sucks.

549
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,000
[Marcus] I kinda liked it.

550
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,291
-Hey, where are you going?
-On a walk.

551
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,708
-Don't go too far.
-[Addison] Okay, Dad.

552
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,458
[Dylan sighs]

553
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,041
[sighs]

554
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,125
[sighs]

555
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,375

556
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,208
[breathes shakily]

557
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,125
-[oxygen tank blowing]
-[Marcus laughs] Hell yeah!

558
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,333
-Go, Dylan!
-[Borney] Come on!

559
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,041
-Don't go higher!
-[Dylan] Hey, Earth girl.

560
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,125
Check it out! [grunts]

561
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,083
-[Caleb] Oh, my God!
-[Borney] Are you seeing this?

562
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:01,541
[Dylan] All right, remember,
the name of the game is launch-off,

563
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,708
so the more you launch, the higher you go.

564
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,458
So you wanna crouch all the way down,

565
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:08,625
and launch as hard as you can
while you open the valve.

566
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:10,250
Are you sure this is safe?

567
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,166
-Of course I-- Borney, don't be a baby.
-You're a baby.

568
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:17,250
What the hell are you doing?
Are you trying to get yourselves killed?

569
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,291
Don't be dramatic, okay?

570
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:22,750
All you gotta do is pump the tank a little
on your way down to slow your fall.

571
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,541
Oh, yeah? And what if the cable snaps?

572
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,541
You'll end up miles away
in the middle of space!

573
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,125
This cable can haul thousands of pounds.
I think we'll be okay.

574
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,625
Also you're wasting oxygen!

575
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:31,958
It's an extra tank.

576
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,333
Which, I'm not quite sure
if you've noticed, we need out here.

577
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:36,666
If we don't use it,
it'll just go to waste.

578
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,666
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

579
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,750
[Dylan sighs]

580
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,708
[Caleb] Wait, Dylan. [sighs]

581
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,833
What do you know?
You thought baseball was fun.

582
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:53,208
-There's a meteor shower warning!
-Do you see any meteors?

583
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,458
[scoffs]

584
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,541
Come on, Earth girl.

585
00:34:57,416 --> 00:35:00,000
Just admit it. You're scared.

586
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,583
[Addison screams, chuckles]

587
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,500
Whoo!

588
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,500
[laughing]

589
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,083
I like her.

590
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,166
She's neat.

591
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,125
[Addison] Whoo!

592
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,708
[Dylan] Yeah. She's all right.

593
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:24,083
[Caleb] Way to go, Addison!

594
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,791
[Addison grunts, chuckles]

595
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,791
[grunting]

596
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,000
[chuckles]

597
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,041
So? What'd you think?

598
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:40,958
I don't know. I guess
you might have been a tiny bit right.

599
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,458
It was just a little bit of fun.

600
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,041
[chuckles]

601
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,208
[both laugh]

602
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,375
[Dylan] You've got this.

603
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,333
Whoa!

604
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:00,041
This is amazing!

605
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,916
[laughs]

606
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,083
[laughing] Whoa! Whoa!

607
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,208
Whoo-hoo!

608
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:10,916
Whoa.

609
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,875
You ready?

610
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:14,375
No, actually,
I think I left something in the rover.

611
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:16,208
-[Dylan] Three, two, one.
-What?

612
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,291
-Launch!

613
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,208
[Borney laughing]

614
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,416
[Borney] Masters of our own fate!

615
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,583
-[Caleb] You got this, Dylan.
-[Borney] Yeah!

616
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:24,833
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-Yeah!

617
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,000
-[Borney] Yeah!
-[Addison] Whoo!

618
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:31,208
-[Caleb] She's doing really good, man.
-High-five!

619
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,916
-Whoa. Whoa.
-[Marcus] Whoo-hoo-hoo!

620
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,541
[Borney] Oh, my God.

621
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,041
Yeah!

622
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,208
Whoa, whoa, wait!

623
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,000
Oh!

624
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,625
Whoo!

625
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:45,875
[laughs]

626
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:02,125
[Marcus] All right, let's go, Borney.

627
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,750
-Whoo!
-[chuckles, whoops]

628
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:06,666
-[Addison] Yeah, Borney!
-Whoa.

629
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,041
[panting]

630
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:15,083
Whoa!

631
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,625
[Borney screaming]

632
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:19,041
-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-Borney!

633
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,333
Wh-- What do we do?

634
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,875
[Borney] Please! Please!
I wanna come down.

635
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:28,125
[grunting, panting]

636
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,750
Borney, listen to me,
you have to shut off the tank.

637
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,000
Shut off the valve on the tank. Okay?

638
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,916
The tank! It slipped. I can't reach it.

639
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,333
If we don't do something,
then we're gonna lose him!

640
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,500
-What are we supposed to do?
-I don't know! You tell me!

641
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,250
[Borney] Please.
I wanna come down, please.

642
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,750
-[Marcus] We need to move. Fast.
-[Addison] And do what?

643
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,708
-[Dylan] Marcus, what are you doing?
-[Addison] Marcus!

644
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:51,708
Mm-hmm.

645
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,041
[Dylan, Caleb panting]

646
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,958
Wait! I'm coming with you.

647
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:56,708
You need to guide us.

648
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:59,208
-We need you to be our eyes down here.
-[panting] I…

649
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,083
Come on, Earth girl. We need you.

650
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,500
Okay.

651
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:09,333
[Caleb grunting, panting]

652
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:13,250
Marcus, your angle is off.
You need to go to your right!

653
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,958
Once Borney unhooks his tank,
he's gonna start to fall.

654
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,583
You're gonna need to catch him.

655
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:21,708
We're gonna get him back.

656
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:26,125
Hey! Hey! We're gonna get him back.

657
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,000
-[Addison] Borney, you're doing great.
-[Borney] I'm scared.

658
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,958
[Addison] Try and stay calm.
Everything's gonna be fine.

659
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,750
-[Borney] Okay.
-[Addison] Come on!

660
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,041
[Dylan, Caleb grunting]

661
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:37,750
Borney, Marcus is on his way.

662
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,208
Please, I need you to listen to me.
You need to unhook your tank.

663
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,875
-I see him! I see him!
-[Addison] Okay?

664
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,166
Borney, you can do it!

665
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,708
Reach down, grab the strap, then pull.

666
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,916
[Borney screaming]

667
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,625
-[Addison] Marcus! Look out!
-[grunting]

668
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,333
[Borney screams] Marcus!

669
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:57,625
-Reach for my hand!
-Help me. Help me, please, Marcus.

670
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:58,958
-I got him.
-[grunts]

671
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:01,125
[Borney] I-- I can't hold on!

672
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,083
-I can't hold on!
-[Marcus] Borney!

673
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,541
[Borney] Oh, God, help!

674
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,916
[Addison] No! No, no, no, no! [whimpers]

675
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,083
I'm right behind ya!

676
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:11,750
[all grunting]

677
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,291
Watch out! Watch out!

678
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,208
[Caleb grunts]

679
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,166
[all grunting, screaming]

680
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,125
[Borney screams]

681
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:19,125
Whoa! Whoa!

682
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:25,083
[all screaming, grunting]

683
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,958
[panting]

684
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,666
[groans, sighs]

685
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,750
[all grunting]

686
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,041
[Marcus panting]
I think I prefer baseball.

687
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,708
[grunting, coughing]

688
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:43,708
[Dylan] Borney! Borney! Are you okay?

689
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:45,333
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-[Dylan] You're sure?

690
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,416
Okay. Okay.

691
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,208
Hey, you better patch up that strap.

692
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:49,958
Luckily,
someone grabbed the crack-smacker.

693
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:51,041
Are you okay?

694
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:54,333
[Dylan] Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

695
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:57,875
I think we have to go back.

696
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:00,750
-What?
-[Marcus grunts]

697
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,416
To the dome. We have to go back.

698
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,500
Look. I get it, okay? I get it.

699
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:12,666
You were right.

700
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,750
It was stupid.

701
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:17,000
Do you really think I care
about being right?

702
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,958
It's just math. We used too much oxygen.

703
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:22,291
You don't know that. [pants]

704
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:25,458
[Addison] You said that you only brought
one extra tank. We lost two.

705
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:28,583
Plus whatever you guys used
getting out there and back.

706
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,416
We wouldn't even have enough
to make it to the crater.

707
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,458
[pants] Oh, my God.
We can figure something out. Right?

708
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:41,041
We all played. It's not your fault.

709
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Wait.

710
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:48,250
What if we can get more?

711
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,083
How?

712
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,500
You still have that projector thingy?

713
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,208
[Dylan] Wait. How is that gonna work?

714
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:55,125
Look. Come with me. I'll show you.

715
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,666
[Dylan, Caleb panting]

716
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,666
{\an8}-No, turn to the left.
-I…

717
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,750
This is left.

718
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,750
-Are you looking for the-- Oh!
-Yeah.

719
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:12,416
-What are we looking for?
-Ooh! Wait. Right there.

720
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,625
-Hey!
-[Dylan] Well, zoom right there! Please?

721
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,833
[Addison] What is this?

722
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,500
[Caleb] That's where we get more oxygen.

723
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,208
It's an old outpost
from the first settlement.

724
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:27,750
It's where miners used to get supplies
for long-range digs.

725
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:30,541
Do you think there's anything left?

726
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:31,458
[sighs]

727
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:34,958
[Caleb] There has to be. It's the only way
we make it to the crater.

728
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,208
[Addison] Dylan, even if this works,

729
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,458
we're gonna be out here
a lot longer than we planned.

730
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:50,625
[Dylan] Okay, but there's time.
Lockdown's not even halfway over.

731
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,625
[Addison] I'm just saying.
At some point, we're gonna have to sleep.

732
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:56,916
[Dylan] Right, sure.
Let's make sure we can breathe first.

733
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,416
So if we're not going back to the dome,
then where are we going?

734
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,708
We're going to an outpost.

735
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,416
It's where we're gonna get more oxygen.

736
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,166
An outpost? What outpost?

737
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,791
There's nothing out here except for--

738
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:16,458
-Wait a minute, not the outpost?
-Here we go.

739
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,958
Are you kidding me? That's the outpost!

740
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,333
-We can't go there.
-[Dylan groans]

741
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,375
Borney, those are just stories.

742
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:23,791
Wait. [chuckles] What?

743
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:26,791
Space ghosts, that's what.

744
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:29,000
-We gotta turn around.
-No. We're not turning around.

745
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:32,208
Borney,
there is no such thing as space ghosts.

746
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:34,500
You don't know.
You guys think you know everything.

747
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,666
-My brother told me--
-No, for crying out loud!

748
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:40,291
You know what? Your brother? He sucks.

749
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,833
-Take that back.
-[Dylan] No.

750
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:43,916
I said, take it back.

751
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,791
No. Because he messes
with your head. Okay?

752
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:47,166
He tells you all these stories

753
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,750
so that you'll walk around
scared of your own shadow all the time.

754
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,750
-The guy's a total loser!
-You're a loser!

755
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,708
-Fine! He's a bigger loser!
-All right. That's enough.

756
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,500
At least I don't have any cowards
in my family.

757
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,125
What'd you say?

758
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,166
-Come here!
-[Caleb] Hey!

759
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,375
-Stop!
-[Dylan] Wanna talk now?

760
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,791
-Don't talk about my brother!
-Hey, Dylan! Stop!

761
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,375
-You wanna talk now?
-Get off me!

762
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,750
[both grunting]

763
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,333
-Enough!
-You know, what? Get off me!

764
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:11,541
-[Caleb] Get off him.
-You hear what he said?

765
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,833
Hey, everybody knock it off!

766
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,916
[panting]

767
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,708
Is this how you guys wanna spend
our last few days together?

768
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:25,375
Come on.

769
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:30,000
[Borney] I'm sorry.

770
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:33,041
Really.

771
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,291
I shouldn't have said that.

772
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:44,541
Yeah. Me too.

773
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:53,416
-I love you, buddy. [chuckles]
-[Borney scoffs]

774
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,958
[Borney] Yeah, yeah. I love you too.

775
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
[chuckles]

776
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,500
[Addison]
You really think there's oxygen in there?

777
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:10,458
[Caleb] I mean, it should be.
These outposts were supply centers.

778
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:12,833
[Marcus]
But that was a long time ago. Right?

779
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:14,791
[Addison] How long?

780
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,666
[metallic thud]

781
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,500
[door beeps, opens]

782
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:39,541
[all breathing shakily]

783
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,916
-[Caleb] Hey.
-[Marcus] What the--

784
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,166
[Caleb] Uh…

785
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:49,083
Uh, what?

786
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,333
Oh. [sighs]

787
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:59,458
The sooner we turn the lights on,
the sooner we get the oxygen tanks, right?

788
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:01,541
-Yeah.
-Right.

789
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:19,833
-[Dylan gasps]
-[Addison] Come on.

790
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:24,750
Careful.

791
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,916
Space ghost!

792
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,041
[all screaming]

793
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:41,666
-[Dylan] Oh, my God!
-[Addison screams]

794
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,041
[screaming]

795
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,833
[screams, grunts]

796
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:47,041
[screaming]

797
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,125
[electricity powers up]

798
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:50,875
Huh?

799
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:52,041
[Marcus] Hmm.

800
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,208
These space ghosts have nice taste.

801
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:55,791
-[Borney] What the…
-What is this place?

802
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:59,125
This isn't an outpost. It's a model home.

803
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,208
[Borney] Huh?

804
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,375
[Caleb] A what?

805
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:07,666
Whenever developers on Earth would build
new communities, like, nice ones,

806
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,875
they'd usually always start out with
one house that was, like, a showcase.

807
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,083
[Borney] This is what the houses here
would have looked like?

808
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:17,625
It's really nice.

809
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,458
I mean, these things are
super creepy, but…

810
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:23,000
At least we don't have to sleep
in the rover tonight.

811
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:26,250
Uh, you're still sleeping in the rover.
You snore.

812
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,333
I just can't wait
to get out of these suits. [chuckles]

813
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:35,875
[Addison] Whoa.

814
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,083
This place is supposed to be packed
with surplus equipment.

815
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:54,958
Where is everything?

816
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:56,750
[Addison] There's a bunch of rooms
we have to check.

817
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:58,291
[Dylan] Yeah, I guess.

818
00:46:58,375 --> 00:46:59,750
Who was Borney talking about?

819
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:04,750
-Uh, in the rover. Who was he--
-Yeah, I know what you meant.

820
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:06,250
What do you wanna know for?

821
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,291
God, you're so--

822
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:12,750
Just forget I even asked.
There's no oxygen here.

823
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,500
[Dylan] All right, fine.

824
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,916
Remember how I said my dad still had
six years left to work off from his dad

825
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,833
before he could even start his own 20?

826
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:27,916
Well, one day, he just--
He just couldn't take it anymore.

827
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:31,833
He decided to sneak onto
one of the shuttles back to Earth.

828
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:36,833
They told my mom
they found him right after takeoff.

829
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:42,125
Don't do that.

830
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,583
-Don't do what?
-Don't-- Don't--

831
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:49,041
Don't stand there and look at me
like you feel bad for me, okay?

832
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,208
You wanna feel bad for someone?
Feel bad for Borney.

833
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:54,083
'Cause I love the kid,
but he's not built for this place.

834
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,250
Marcus?
He probably got born with that heart

835
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,125
because his family's
been up here too long.

836
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,541
Screwed him all up.

837
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:01,208
So you wanna feel bad for someone?

838
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:04,500
Feel bad for them,
because I don't need your pity.

839
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:06,833
Pity? I wasn't…

840
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,541
God, you guys think that you're the only
people who have problems in your life.

841
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,291
What, you think my life is perfect?

842
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,041
-I don't know.
-[Addison] No, you don't know.

843
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:17,958
I bet you don't know a thing about me.

844
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:20,166
I'm just the girl who helped you
and your friends steal a rover

845
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,041
so that you could have
your little adventure.

846
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,208

I don't feel bad for you.

849

I was just trying to get to know you.

Are you kidding me?

854
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,208
Every time you take a nap,
the ground shakes on Omega.

855
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,291
That's not true.

856
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,458
How would you know?
You're too busy sleeping.

857
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:46,625
I'd know.

858
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:51,208
Whoa!

859
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:52,625
That's a lot of stuff.

860

Hey, do you think
Caleb's having a good time?

863
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:08,958
I mean, I know he's sad about leaving,
about his dad.

864
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,041
But I just…

865
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,916
I want him to have a good time, you know?

866
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:17,333
I know.

Okay. Promise.

872
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,541
[Caleb] Dad?

873
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,791
You in here?

874
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:06,416
[Michael] What?

875
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,750
Dad,
why were you just sitting in the dark?

876
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,083
[Michael] The math doesn't work.

877
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:14,541
[Caleb] What?

878
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,125
There's not enough time.

879
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,666
The math doesn't work.

880
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:20,708
Dad,

881
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,541
what are you talking about?

882
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:30,875
When your mom was pregnant,
she was so scared you'd end up stuck here.

883
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:34,583
Turn 18
before we finished out the contract.

884
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:37,958
But the math worked, see?

885
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,500
As long as we worked hard, stayed focused.

886
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,750
But your mom got sick.

887
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,666
And I took too much time.

888
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,333
Figured I'd make it up.

889
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:58,208
Work it off before you turned 18.

890
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:00,708
Before they put 20 years on you.

891
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:06,291

Oh, yeah!
And we didn't just find the oxygen tanks.

00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:36,291

so many different types of food.

900
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:37,875

-[Marcus] Nice one.
-That was impressive.

903

I don't think I'm ever going to eat
anything ever again.

904
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:47,791
There's so many flavors right in my mouth
right now, I don't even know what to do.

905
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:49,208
-What is that?
-Um…

906
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:52,666
It's called, uh, "freeze-dried ice cream."

907
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:54,291
Is it good?

908
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:56,500
I think it is the most amazing thing
I've ever tasted.

909
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,166
-Here, let me try it.
-Wait.

910
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,333
No, let me try it.

-Give me some.
-Hey.

912
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:02,625
You can't hog it all. Dude! Dylan!

00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:04,083
-Oh, my God! This is amazing.
-You can't--

-You can't hog it all to yourself.
-Come on. Give me some.

-Dude, come on. One piece.

was actually at war with each other.

Literally millions of people died.

00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:20,875
That's insane.

920
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,708
[Addison] Yeah, I mean,
that's not the only part.

921
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:25,041
The entire thing happened
again 20 years later.

922
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,291
You wouldn't believe the stuff
that you find in history books.

923
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:30,791
You guys would love it.

924
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:34,208
It's just all of this stuff that dates
back, like, thousands of years.

925
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:38,750
All these different cultures
and belief systems and…

926
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:43,291
It's all so beautiful and so sad and so…

927
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,416
I don't know. It's just all of this stuff
really happened.

928
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,833
To people who thought it was the most
important thing in the entire universe.

929
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,583
And Earth was everything to them.

930
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:03,541
Now, it's like all anybody cares about is
when they get to go to Omega.

931
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:14,875
My brother always really loved history.

932
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:16,958

933
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,583
Yeah, his name is Charlie.

He's ten.

935
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:29,375
He's on a transport ship with my mom
to Omega right now.

936
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,750
See,

937
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:37,541
when my parents got divorced…

938
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:45,416
it wasn't enough for my mom to just move
out of the house like a normal person.

939
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,875
She actually chose to spend 75 years
in a cryogenic sleep,

940
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:52,958
so she'd never have to see my dad again.

941
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:58,916
And my dad,

942
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:04,041
for some reason,
just couldn't let her have the last word.

943
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:06,958
So he just had to leave Earth too.

944
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,875
So, here we are.

945
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:20,375
She brought Charlie with her
onto the transport ship last year.

946
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:26,708

1017
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:48,833
[all screaming]

1018
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:51,791
Yeah! Yeah!

1019
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,125
[song fades, ends]

1020
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,250
[snoring]

1021
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:28,208
[footsteps approaching]

1022
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:33,083
Can't sleep?

1023
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:35,916
Figure I'll be sleeping plenty
soon enough.

1024
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,125
[Caleb sighs]

1025
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,041
[Dylan] That is not a cookie.

1026
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:43,583
[Addison] What?

1027
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:46,375
Because I already had one.

1028
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:48,833
[Caleb] He talks in his sleep a lot.

1029
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:49,958
[Addison] You're kidding.

1030
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,875
It's really weird.

1031
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:55,000
Most people mumble. Dylan has arguments.

1032
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,083
[chuckles]

1033
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,916
They're gonna miss you.

1034
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,375
[sighs] I know.

1035
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:16,708
The first time I met Dylan,
it was the night my mom died.

1036
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:19,791
Then I went to the commissary.

1037
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:24,458
I'd been crying nonstop for hours and,
I guess,

1038
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:27,291
all of a sudden I just realized
how hungry I was.

1039
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:33,333
It was like after all that,
if I could just get a sandwich,

1040
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,625
maybe everything would be okay.

1041
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,875
But when I got to the commissary,
everything was locked for the night.

1042
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:43,000
What did you do?

1043
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:48,291
Well, um, I was about
to head back to the dorms

1044
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:52,708
when all of a sudden Dylan comes out
of the air vent above the door.

1045
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:54,875
[chuckles]

1046
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:58,291
He said he'd been breaking in for months
to steal fruit tarts for his mom.

1047
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:04,541
[chuckles] So we snuck back inside
and spent the rest of the night

1048
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:07,625
in a giant refrigerator eating sandwiches.

1049
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:09,666
[chuckles]

1050
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,875
I didn't even know who he was,

1051
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:17,291
and he still sat there with me
the whole night.

1052
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:28,291
Why'd you tell me all that?

1053
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:34,291
Because I think
it's gonna be hard for him.

1054
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:36,250
When I'm gone.

1055
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,791
Harder for him than the others.

1056
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:42,541
He might need someone to stay up with him,

1057
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,666
eat some sandwiches. [chuckles]

1058
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:51,500
Hmm, I barely know him.

1059
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,083
Well, he didn't know me either.

1060
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:58,041
[sighs]

1061
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:11,041
You know, we're kind of the same.

1062
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,333
What do you mean?

1063
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:17,916
Well, neither of us really gets to be
who we are anymore.

1064
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:22,125
We're both something different now.

1065
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:27,125
I'm just the girl from Earth,

1066
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:30,083
and you're just the boy
whose parents died.

1067
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:40,541
I already told you,
it's not supposed to be green.

1068
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,958
[Addison, Caleb chuckling]

1069
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:45,208
[Caleb] Yeah.

1070
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:06,791
Hey, are we there yet?

1071
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:07,875
[all] No.

1072
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,000
We're five minutes closer
than the last time you asked though.

1073
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:12,166
Okay, well, how much further?

1074
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:14,166
The map only says
about another mile or so.

1075
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:17,791
[alarm beeping]

1076
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:18,875
What's going on?

1077
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:21,666
Hey, what's happening?

1078
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,500
I don't-- I don't know. It just--

1079
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:25,375
What?

1080
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,125
What did you do?

1081
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:30,208
I didn't do anything. [sighs]
It's an old model. It just--

1082
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:31,458
[sighs] Come on.

1083
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,125
[sighs] We're so screwed.

1084
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,000
[Dylan] Come on, come on, come on.

1085
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:37,083
[Caleb] Okay.

1086
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:39,625
How much oxygen did we get from the depot?

1087
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:41,875
Not enough to make it back
to the colony on foot.

1088
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,000
Well, how about to get to the crater?

1089
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:46,125
[Dylan] Oh, yeah,
we got enough for that, but…

1090
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:47,708
I don't know.

1091
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:49,416
[distress signal blaring]

1092
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,250
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

1093
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,208
-That's the distress signal.
-[Addison] Yeah.

1094
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:55,333
We're in a broken-down rover
in the middle of nowhere.

1095
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:56,250
-Oh, my God.
-[groans]

1096
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:58,625
We're gonna be in so much trouble
when they catch us out here.

1097
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,291
We're gonna be in even more trouble
if they don't.

1098
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,625
Look, the good news is
that the rescue vehicles can't leave

1099
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,375
until the dome's lockdown is over.

1100
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,333
We've got plenty of time
to get to the crater and back.

1101
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:11,666
Don't you guys really wanna know
what's out there?

1102
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,875
Don't you?

1103
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:35,375
[panting]

1104
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,041
[Michael]
I need you to promise me something.

1105
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,083
Will you promise me?

1106
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,208
Okay.

1107
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:08,083
Anything ever happens to me,

1108
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:11,625
you promise me you'll get out there
to the crater, like we talked about.

1109
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:13,708
Wait, Dad. What's gonna happen to you?

1110
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:16,166
Nothing.

1111
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:17,875
I just--

1112
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:20,958
I promised your mom.

1113
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:22,125
The night she died,

1114
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:27,791
I held her hand,
and I promised her you'd see it.

1115
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:31,333
So you promise me now.

1116
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:33,541
You promise me you'll go.

1117
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:37,958
Okay. I promise.

1118
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,541
[Michael] Okay, no matter what.

1119
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:42,875
And you look for the place with the brook.

1120
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:44,958
It splits, it goes in two.

1121
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:48,041
That's where you look. That's the spot.

1122
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,625
Dad, I don't know what that means. I--

1123
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,333
It's okay, you will.

1124
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,208
You'll see.

1125
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,291
Okay?

1126
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:02,875
Good.

1127
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:04,791
Good man.

1128
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:15,708
[Michael groans]

1129
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,833
Hey.

1130
01:05:22,291 --> 01:05:23,375
I love you, Caleb.

1131
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:25,541
More than anything.

1132
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:27,708
You know that, right?

1133
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:32,375
Yeah, Dad. Love you too.

1134
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:37,041
My baby boy.

1135
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:45,708
[Dylan panting]

1136
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:50,500
[Dylan] Hey, guys.

1137
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:55,291
I think we're here.

1138
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,166
Come on. [pants]

1139
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,708
[all panting]

1140
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,083
[Borney grunts]

1141
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:16,000
[Dylan] We made it.

1142
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,833
-[Marcus] What do you think it is?
-[Caleb] Wow.

1143
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:22,958
[Dylan] We really did it. [chuckles]
We're here, man.

1144
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:25,000
[Caleb] Yeah.

1145
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,791
Hey, last one down
doesn't get any treasure.

1146
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:29,958
[Marcus] W-Wait, Borney.

1147
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:31,000
[Borney] Oh, whoa.

1148
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:34,125
Whoa. Whoa. [chuckles]

1149
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:38,166
Whoa. [chuckles] Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1150
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,250
Marcus?

1151
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,166
-[Addison] Whoo!
-[Marcus] Whoa!

1152
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:46,875
You ever have this much fun on Earth?

1153
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,250
[Addison]
I've never had this much fun anywhere.

1154
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:51,333
[Addison, Marcus laughing]

1155
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:55,666
Hey, you coming?

1156
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:57,791
Yeah.

1157
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,416
Okay.

1158
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:09,500
[Dylan laughing] Whoo! Whoo!

1159
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:14,000
[Caleb grunts]

1160
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:15,166
[Caleb] Yeah.

1161
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:17,833
[chuckling] Whoa.

1162
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:21,375
[Dylan] Caleb! This is awesome!

1163
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:22,458
Yeah!

1164
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:24,750
[Caleb, Dylan laughing]

1165
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,458
-[Caleb] Whoa.
-[Dylan] Whoa.

1166
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:33,125
[Borney] Hey, Marcus. Any luck?

1167
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:35,125
[Marcus] I'm still looking.

1168
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:38,375
[Addison] Hey, guys. Come look at this.

1169
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,708
[Dylan] What does it mean?

1170
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:52,916
[Marcus] Guys,
I found the control for the door.

1171
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:55,833
[Caleb] Guess we'll find out.

1172
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:58,333
[door opens]

1173
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:06,666
[Dylan sighs]

1174
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:11,666
[Marcus] You first, Caleb.

1175
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,458
Hey, you got this.

1176
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:19,625
[Marcus panting]

1177
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:38,291
[panting]

1178
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:42,750
[Addison exhales]

1179
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:45,666
[Caleb grunts]

1180
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:55,166
[Dylan sighs]

1181
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,375
[Borney] Oh, come on.

1182
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:08,458
[Dylan] This can't be it.

1183
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,041
It's just a giant empty room.

1184
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:16,125
I think we're at the wrong place.

1185
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:18,791
[sighs]

1186
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:22,541
Maybe whatever used to
be here is just gone.

1187
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:24,416
[sighs]

1188
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:28,708
Wow.

1189
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:32,625
"On gilded wings
we have reached the stars.

1190
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:37,458
But let us never forget the skies
we left behind."

[Addison exhales]

1192
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
What are you doing?

1193
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,833
I've been in a room like this before.

1194
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:50,041
Just give me a second.

1195
01:10:01,291 --> 01:10:02,291
[gasps]

1196
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,000
[Caleb] Wow. [chuckles]

1197
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,416
[Addison chuckling]

1198
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,500
[Borney] Cool!

1199
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:14,166
What's going on?

1200
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,916
[Borney] I think we're gonna die.

1201
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,416
[Dylan] We're not gonna die, Borney.

1202
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:19,291
[Addison] Just give it a second.

1203
01:10:25,291 --> 01:10:28,833
-[Marcus gasps] Are you guys seeing this?
-[Addison chuckles]

1204
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:34,250
[birds chirping]

1205
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:35,916
[Borney] Marcus. Marcus, look!

1206
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:42,625
[Marcus] It's beautiful.

1207
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:46,791
Wow.

1208
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:48,291
[Borney] Whoa.

1209
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
[Addison chuckling]

1210
01:10:55,666 --> 01:10:56,916
[Marcus] I can't believe it.

1211
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:58,875
[Dylan] Is that--

1212
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,583
That's Earth.

1213
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:05,791
That's home.

1214
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:09,208
[chuckles]

1215
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:12,041

1216

[Addison chuckling]

1217
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:17,125
Look!

1218
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,333
[Marcus] It is blue. [chuckles]

1219
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:32,458
[Borney] See? I told you guys
there'd be treasure.

1220
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,500
-[Dylan chuckles, sighs]
-[Addison giggles]

1221
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,583
[water running]

1222
01:11:56,750 --> 01:12:00,083
[electricity humming]

1223
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:01,166
Huh?

1224
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,166
-What?
-[Marcus] No.

1225
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:06,208
[Borney] No. No, what happ--
What happened?

1226
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:08,541
[Marcus] Is that all there is?

1227
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,625
[Addison] I don't know.

1228
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,416
-[Borney] No, no, no. No. No!
-[Marcus] Make it come back.

1229
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,291
-You can make it come back, right?
-Where did it go?

1230
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:16,875
-[Addison] Look, I can try.
-[Marcus] Please.

1231
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:34,250
Hey. Hey, Caleb, what did you find?

1232
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,250
[Marcus shushing]

1233
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:23,541
[sighs]

1234
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:36,958
Hey, your dad would've wanted this.

1235
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,333
-[Caleb sniffles]
-He would've been proud.

1236
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,625
Don't say that.

1237
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:41,708
What?

1238
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:43,541
Hey, Caleb, stop.

1239
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:49,416
Look, I get it's hard. Okay? I get it.

1240
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,833
But, you can't just--

1241
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:52,416
It wasn't an accident.

1242
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:55,875
In the mines.

1243
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,041
What happened wasn't an accident.

1244
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:01,541
My dad knew about the death benefit.

1245
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:04,625
He knew if anything happened to him
that I'd get to go to Omega.

1246
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,875
When we get back, I'm telling Ms. Slater.

1247
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:11,041
What?

1248
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:14,750
Maybe she'll cancel the contract,
revoke the benefit.

1249
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:16,541
I could stay.

1250
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:23,333
Look, everything about this sucks.

1251
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,125
But none of that matters.

1252
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,333
Because you're the one that gets to go.

1253
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:33,500
Whatever you think your dad did,
he did it because he loved you.

1254
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:38,041
Dude, I would give anything
to get off this rock.

1255
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:39,875
We all would. And you know that.

1256
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:42,083
But we're gonna spend
the rest of our lives here.

1257
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:43,250
And that's fine.

1258
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:46,541
You know why?

1259
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:49,583
Because when you go,
a part of us gets to go too.

1260
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:51,541
You're gonna be out there
for the rest of us.

1261
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:54,083
It's gonna be amazing.

1262
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:56,375
-You're gonna forget all about this place.
-No, I won't.

1263
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,875
[Dylan] Yes, you will.

1264
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:00,500
And you should.

1265
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:04,875
Caleb, you've got
so much more ahead of you.

1266
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:09,333
So many things you're gonna see and do.

1267
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,166
You're gonna be a leader.

1268
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:16,583
Somebody people depend on.

1269
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:20,708
Somebody that goes
where other people are scared to go.

1270
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,541
You don't think we're gonna
let you ruin that, do you?

1271
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,083
-[Marcus groans]
-[body thuds]

1272
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:29,125
[Borney] Marcus! Hey!

1273
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:30,333
Oh, my God!

1274
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:31,666
-Hey! Marcus!
-[Dylan] Hey, it's okay.

1275
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,125
Hey. I'm okay. I'm okay.

1276
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:35,083
-[grunts] What happened?
-[Marcus] It's okay.

1277
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:36,875
His heart rate is way too low.

1278
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:38,500
No. No, no, but he took all his pills.

1279
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:40,375
You guys have never been
outside before, right?

1280
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,291
[Dylan] No.

1281
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:43,541
The low gravity could be affecting
his blood pressure.

1282
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:44,875
So give him another pill.

1283
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:46,750
I can't. They're back at the rover.

1284
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,375
-Oh, no.
-Why didn't you say anything, Marcus?

1285
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:50,541
I didn't wanna ruin the trip.

1286
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:52,250
-Please. No, no, no.
-Okay. Come on.

1287
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:54,333
We need to get him back
to the rover, like, now.

1288
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:55,500
Okay. Let's move.

1289
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,083
-Okay. Come on.

[Dylan] Right behind you, Marcus.

Come on, yeah. Push. Go.

1294

-[Marcus grunts]
-Take my hand.

1295
01:16:14,625 --> 01:16:15,875

The rover's right there.

1309
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:02,083
-We need to make a run for it.
-We're never gonna make it.

1310
01:17:02,166 --> 01:17:04,333
Yes, we will. Borney, look at me.

1311
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,458
-I can't.
-You want us to die out here?

1312
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:09,041
-Do you want Marcus to die?
-No.

1313
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,000
Then tell me you can do this.

1314
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:12,166
I can do it.

1315

-I can do it!

1316

Okay.

01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:39,625
[Caleb grunts]

1364
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:42,541
Oh, my God!

1365
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:44,625
[Caleb, Addison panting]

1366
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:49,125
I got you. Come on.

1367
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,375
-Let's get--
-Get him up.

1368
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:52,458
[straining]

1369
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:55,166
Let's go!

1370
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:02,250
[Caleb grunting]

1371
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,750
[banging on door]

1372
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:08,958
[Addison] Come on, Borney! Open up! Bor--

1373
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:10,458
-[grunts]
-[door whirs]

1374
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:13,750
[Addison sighs, pants]

1375
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:19,458
What happened?

1376
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:26,166
-[Borney breathes shakily] Is he--
-He's fine.

1377
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:27,208
[rumbling]

1378
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:28,416
-He's fi--
-[Borney gasps]

1379
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,583
He's fine. It's gonna--

1380
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:36,125
The rescue vehicles
are gonna be here soon.

1381
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,041
No, they won't.

1382
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:42,291
The storm.

1383
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,083
It means they're still on lockdown.

1384
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:48,625
They aren't coming.

1385
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:49,958
[crying] No. Don't say that.

1386
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:52,500
-[Caleb] I'm sorry.
-No, don't--

1387
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:55,041
Don't say that.

1388
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,083
Okay, they're-- They'll be here.

1389
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:02,958
Right, it's gonna--
Everything's gonna be fine.

1390
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:06,125
-[rumbling]
-[Borney whimpering]

1391
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,125
[Addison] They'll be here.

1392
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:34,708
[Marcus] Addison…

1393
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:39,041
what happens when we run out of oxygen?

1394
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:43,333
Well…

1395
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,375
As the levels get lower…

1396
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:55,500
your suit will start
to recycle carbon dioxide.

1397
01:21:56,791 --> 01:22:00,125
And you'll just start to get really tired.

1398
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:06,291
Once you're asleep, the suit powers down.

1399
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:10,791
It will try to make the oxygen last
as long as possible.

1400
01:22:12,291 --> 01:22:14,291
Then at some point, you'll just…

1401
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:17,541
slip away.

1402
01:22:19,416 --> 01:22:20,500
It's peaceful.

1403
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,583
Well…

1404
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:26,125
that sounds okay, I guess.

1405
01:22:28,416 --> 01:22:29,416
[chuckles]

1406
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:34,125
[Addison, Marcus chuckling]

1407
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:55,375
[sniffles]

1408
01:22:57,291 --> 01:22:59,291
[breathes shakily]

1409
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:10,000
Caleb?

1410
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:11,208
Huh?

1411
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,458
Hey, man. I'm right here.

1412
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:14,625
How long was I asleep?

1413
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:16,833
For a while.

1414
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:18,791
A few hours at least.

1415
01:23:21,583 --> 01:23:22,750
The rescue vehicles?

1416
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,083
They're on their way.

1417
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:29,208
Everything's gonna be just fine.

1418
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,750
You're a pretty bad liar. You know that?

1419
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:35,833
[chuckles]

1420
01:23:39,708 --> 01:23:40,708
Are they--

1421
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:45,541
[Caleb] They're just sleeping.

1422
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,583
I never should have made you guys
come out here.

1423
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:55,541
[Dylan sighs]

1424
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,666
You're an idiot.

1425
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:03,291
These were the best two days of my life.

1426
01:24:04,083 --> 01:24:05,666
Same goes for them.

1427
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:09,666
We got to see the sky, man.

1428
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:11,666
All that blue.

1429
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:17,375
It's the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

1430
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:25,250
So quit pissing and moaning
about how bad you feel.

1431
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:26,500
[chuckles]

1432
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:30,875
[Dylan] Besides,
you didn't make us do anything.

1433
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:36,333
I would've dragged you out here
whether you wanted to go or not.

1434
01:24:36,416 --> 01:24:37,791
[both chuckling]

1435
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:40,375
-That's probably true.
-You're damn right it's true.

1436
01:24:44,083 --> 01:24:45,250
And don't laugh.

1437
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:47,583
You're wasting oxygen.

1438
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,666
[both laughing]

1439
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:06,083
You'll always be my best friend.

1440
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:09,333
No matter what.

1441
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,750
I know.

1442
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:28,958
[suits beeping, powering down]

1443
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:38,625
Dylan?

1444
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:40,625
[suit beeps, powers down]

1445
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:41,708
Dylan?

1446
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:45,583
Dylan, what's going on? Dylan?

1447
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:49,333
Dylan.

1448
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:52,250
[breathing heavily]

1449
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:57,666
[suit beeps, powers down]

1450
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:14,625
-[comm beeps]
-[rescue] Lunar rover?

1451
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:16,958
This is rescue vehicle two. Do you copy?

1452
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:20,500
We have visual contact
and are approaching.

1453
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:21,666
Please acknowledge.

1454
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:34,750
Dylan?

1455
01:26:35,666 --> 01:26:36,666
[sighs]

1456
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:38,375
Guys?

1457
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:41,250
Huh? [grunts]

1458
01:26:41,333 --> 01:26:43,000
[nurse] Easy. Not too fast.

1459
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:44,500
Your body's been through a lot.

1460
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:45,583
[sighs]

1461
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,833
Is everyone okay?

1462
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,416
Everyone's fine.

1463
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:53,666
The trip was a complete success.

1464
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:56,041
Trip?

1465
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:58,708
[grunts]

1466
01:26:58,791 --> 01:26:59,791
What trip?

1467
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:01,958
Aboard the transport.

1468
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:05,041
You're on Omega, Caleb.

1469
01:27:06,791 --> 01:27:07,875
What?

1470
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:08,958
No.

1471
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:10,708
No.

1472
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:12,083
No! No! No! No!

1473
01:27:12,166 --> 01:27:13,291
-I have to go.
-[nurse] You can't.

1474
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,000
-I have to go-- I can't--
-Hey. It's all right.

1475
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:18,333
I was just on the rover. I fell asleep.
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1476
01:27:18,416 --> 01:27:21,416
[birds chirping]

1477
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,541
[nurse] It's difficult at first.

1478
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:38,583
You're going to need time to adjust.

1479
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:41,666
This may help.

1480
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:44,666
What is it?

1481
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:47,416
Messages from the Lunar colony.

1482
01:27:48,166 --> 01:27:50,583
From the last 75 years while you slept.

1483
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:59,291
There's a foster family
you'll be staying with.

1484
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,791
They're coming by this afternoon.

1485
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:03,375
They're very excited to meet you.

1486
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:21,708
[sighs]

1487
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:26,375
[sighs]

1488
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:36,583
[device beeps]

1489
01:28:38,666 --> 01:28:42,500
[Dylan] Hey, man. Uh, you're not gonna
hear this for a pretty long time,

1490
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:44,583
which is really weird.

1491
01:28:44,666 --> 01:28:47,125
Anyway, there's some folks here
who wanted to say hi.

1492
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:49,208
-[Addison] Hi, Caleb!
-[Borney] Uh, where do I talk?

1493
01:28:49,291 --> 01:28:51,291
[Marcus] Uh,
just put your face near the microphone.

1494
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:54,375
[Borney] Oh, oh, oh.
There it is. Hi, Caleb!

1495
01:28:54,458 --> 01:28:56,416
[Marcus] Uh, hi, Caleb.
I hope Omega's nice.

1496
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,000
[Dylan] All right, guys. Come on, come on.

1497
01:28:58,083 --> 01:28:59,083
We're on a clock here.

1498
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:01,750
Anyway, I wanted you to know
that everyone's okay

1499
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:04,166
so that you didn't worry when you woke up.

1500
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:07,041
-Addison talked to her dad and--
-[Addison] Actually, I yelled at him.

1501
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:08,208
[Dylan] Yeah, she did.

1502
01:29:08,291 --> 01:29:10,708
He said that they'd let me use
the transmitter once a year.

1503
01:29:10,791 --> 01:29:12,916
Apparently, that's way more than usual.

1504
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,750
So, you'll have plenty of catching up
to do when you wake up.

1505
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:20,291
And, listen, don't be sad. Okay?

1506
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:22,250
Things are gonna be okay.

1507
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:24,916
For you, for us, for everyone.

1508
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:26,875
I love you, man!

1509
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:28,041
[Addison] I love you too!

1510
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:29,375
[Dylan] Addison loves you too.

1511
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:38,250
[device beeps]

1512
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:40,208
[Dylan] Hey, buddy.

1513
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:44,083
I can't believe it's been a year already.

1514
01:29:44,166 --> 01:29:45,416
[chuckles]

1515
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,833
I don't know what you said
to Addison before you left,

1516
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:49,750
but the girl won't leave me alone.

1517
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:53,583
All year she's been showing up
with sandwiches.

1518
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:56,083
I guess it's not so bad though.

1519
01:29:57,416 --> 01:30:00,416
Hey. Everybody misses you, man.

1520
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:02,750
We talk about you all the time.

1521
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:10,208
[sighs]

1522
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:17,416
[device beeps]

1523
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,666
[Dylan]
It's hard to believe it's been so long.

1524
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:22,375
It feels like just yesterday
we were out there planning our trip.

1525
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:23,708
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1526
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:26,083
[Dylan] And now here I am working
down in the mines.

1527
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:29,791
At least all that wonderful schooling
is paying off.

1528
01:30:29,875 --> 01:30:30,708
Yeah.

1529
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:32,750
[Dylan] It's not so bad though.

1530
01:30:33,458 --> 01:30:35,333
Borney and I are on the same crew.

1531
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:38,416
And Marcus is trying to get his foreman
to let him rotate over.

1532
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:42,166
-Addison keeps staging these protests…
-This way.

1533
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,583
…demanding changes in the contracts.

1534
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:48,875
The funny thing is,

1535
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:51,791
we were just walking
down the hall one day…

1536
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:54,875
[laughing] …and she held my hand.

1537
01:30:57,041 --> 01:31:00,625
And then we just--
Neither one of us let go.

1538
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,416
Caleb! She did it!

1539
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,166
She actually did it!

1540
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:15,583
She finally got them to close
all the loopholes in the contract.

1541
01:31:15,666 --> 01:31:19,666
No more passing down unfinished hours
from one generation to the next.

1542
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:22,500
And now she's got Borney
helping her form a commission

1543
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:25,208
to restart all those
old construction projects.

1544
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:28,583
So Borney wears a suit and tie now.

1545
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:31,916
Yeah, but we still give him a hard time
about the space ghosts though.

1546
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
[device beeps]

1547
01:31:33,083 --> 01:31:36,666
[adult Dylan] I know I'm early this year,
but I couldn't wait.

1548
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:39,000
I asked Addison to marry me.

1549
01:31:39,083 --> 01:31:40,458
She said yes!

1550
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:44,250
Man, I think back to that day
she and I met in the cafeteria.

1551
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,833
We were all so nervous
about bringing the Earth girl along.

1552
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,041
Guess what.

1553
01:31:51,583 --> 01:31:53,666
Marcus started a baseball league.

1554
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:57,250
I still don't get the game,
but kids here seem to like it.

1555
01:31:57,916 --> 01:32:01,041
Now he's got a whole team
bugging him about his pills.

1556
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:03,541
We're just glad the big guy is still here.

1557
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:06,833
Addison's pregnant.

1558
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,750
I'm gonna be a dad.

1559
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:10,666
-[passerby] Hi.
-[adult Dylan] Can you believe that?

1560
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:13,250
-[Caleb] Where can I find it?
-Follow that path…

1561
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:16,041
[adult Dylan] I look around now
at everything that's changed,

1562
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:18,291
the lives, the homes we built.

1563
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:20,625
It's because of you.

1564
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:25,666
You brought us out of that dome
and showed us what this place could be.

1565
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,416
That's the world we made.

1566
01:32:30,333 --> 01:32:31,666
It's funny.

1567
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:34,375
The more that time goes by,

1568
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:38,166
the more I realize just how much
that trip really meant.

1569
01:32:39,291 --> 01:32:42,041
There are these moments
that only happen once.

1570
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:45,083
Those are the ones you hold on to.

1571
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:47,166
They become the stories that you tell.

1572
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:51,416
That way you never really have
to say goodbye.

1573
01:32:56,041 --> 01:33:00,958
[elderly Dylan] It's so strange to think
of you out there still frozen in time.

1574
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,041
You have no idea how much joy
it's brought us all these years

1575
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:11,208
to imagine the incredible things
you'll do, all the adventures you'll have.

1576
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:17,125
Hey, I'm taking my grandkids out
to the crater next week.

1577
01:33:17,208 --> 01:33:18,708
Can you imagine that?

1578
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,833
We have good lives here, Caleb.

1579
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:25,000
We became the masters of our own fate.

1580
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,500
And now, my friend,

1581
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:30,291
it's time for you
to become the master of yours.

1582
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:31,375
[sighs]

1583
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:34,875
[device beeps]

1584
01:33:38,416 --> 01:33:40,416
[birds chirping]

1585
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,666
[sighs]

1586
01:33:58,750 --> 01:33:59,750
Hi.

1587
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:02,041
Hello.

1588
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:04,250
I was told I could find you here.

1589
01:34:07,666 --> 01:34:10,083
I think this belongs to you.

1590
01:34:12,208 --> 01:34:13,541
[gasps]

1591
01:34:13,625 --> 01:34:15,250
Your sister was a friend of mine.

1592
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:20,416
Wait a second. Are you Caleb?

1593
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:24,875
My sister talked about you a lot
on my transmitter.

1594
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:28,708
I think she must have snuck this
into my bag before I left.

1595
01:34:29,916 --> 01:34:31,583
She'd probably want you to have it.

1596
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:33,625
[chuckles]

1597
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,000
I never thought I'd see this again.

1598
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:45,458
I think you and I are gonna have
a lot to talk about.

1599
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,500
[chuckles]

1600
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:49,083
[sighs]

1601
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:53,666
Did you guys really steal a rover
and go across the moon?

1602
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:54,750
Sure did.

1603
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:58,750
Addison said you almost blew
one of your friends into space.

1604
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:01,541
[chuckles] We didn't blow him into space.

1605
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:03,375
We were just playing launch-off.

1606
01:35:03,458 --> 01:35:05,083
-What's launch-off?
-It's a game.

1607
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,541
See what you had to do is,
you get an oxygen tank,

1608
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:10,875
turn it upside down, and you hold it
in front of you as tight as you can,

1609
01:35:10,958 --> 01:35:12,083
like this.

1610
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,875
Why do you turn it upside down?

1611
01:35:14,958 --> 01:35:16,625
That's where you get the propulsion.

1612
01:35:17,166 --> 01:35:19,250
This game seems like a terrible idea.

1613
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:23,541
Yeah. Your sister thought so too.

1614
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:27,500
You know,
I'm gonna need someone to show me around.

1615
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:29,375
You think you're up for it?

1616
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,375
Really? Me?

1617
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:35,208
What are you doing tomorrow?

1618
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:37,791
[Caleb] Well,
I guess we're going on an adventure.
