00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:31,000
He was good. Oh, he was great.

860
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:36,250
He had all the skills
and he was strong and fast.

861
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:39,583
He could really, really fly.

862
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:42,708
[video game music playing]

863
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:45,291
What are you doing?

864
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:51,125
Don't you want to know about your dad
before you came along?

865
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:55,250
It hurts me too, you know that.

866
00:56:56,125 --> 00:57:00,791
But we have to take it in,
we have to face it, feel it, all of it.

867
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:05,250
Alex, look at me.

868
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:10,041
Hey! [sighs] What are you doing?

869
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,750
Talking to my grandson.

870
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:13,166
I don't feel like talking.

871
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,375
All right.

872
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:21,375
Then… let's fight.

873
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:22,291
What?

874
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:26,125
Yeah. You want this back?
You're gonna have to fight for it.

875
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,750
I'm not gonna fight you.

876
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:30,041
Well, then, you're not getting this back.

877
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,291
[groans] Really?

878
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:37,250
Pick it up, put it on,
make your dad proud.

879
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,833
-Let's do this.
-[sighs]

880
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:47,208
[in Spanish] They'll fight two
out of three rounds with no time limit.

881
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:49,791
In this corner, the legend, the myth…

882
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:52,750
the one and only Relámpago Azul!

883
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:54,333
[Chava grunting]

884
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:03,125
And in this corner, the surprise
of the night, El Perico Verde!

885
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:05,083
[Alex, in English] This is so stupid.

886
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:08,666
Shouldn't we be helping Chupa?
That man could come back at any moment.

887
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,791
I agree.

888
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,666
[Chava] No, no, no. Not yet.

889
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,583
I first have to teach Alex
an important lesson.

890
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:16,833
Come on, son. Show me what you got.

891
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:17,791
<i>Abuelo.</i>

892
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:19,000
[in Spanish] Fight!

893
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:22,375
-[in English] This is stupid.
-[Chava] Come on! [grunting]

894
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:26,791
You're sad, son. That's normal.

895
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:28,083
[Memo] He has him by the neck!

896
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:29,041
[Chava] You're hurt.

897
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:31,708
[Alex] I'm not hurt.
I just really want to be left alone.

898
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:34,041
-[Chava] No. That's okay.
-[grunting]

899
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:36,208
Let it out. Let it out. All right?

900
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:39,833
Channel those emotions.
Take it all out on me. Come on.

901
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,500
[Alex] I don't want to fight you.

902
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:43,583
[Memo, in Spanish]
He throws him to the ground!

903
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:47,625
Leave him alone.

904
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:49,750
[in English] I've been watching you, Alex.

905
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:50,833
Get off me!

906
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:51,791
[in Spanish] One…

907
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:54,666
[Chava, in English] Every time
your dad gets brought up,

908
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,666
you retreat and hide
in that stupid game of yours.

909
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,000
You're choking me!

910
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,000
[in Spanish] Two…

911
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:03,416
[in English] Face your pain,
face your fears and your sorrow.

912
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,583
You have to feel the pain of the sadness.

913
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:08,291
-[in Spanish] And three!
-[Chava cheering]

914
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:10,375
Azul!

915
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,708
[Alex yelling]

916
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:16,750
[Chava grunts]

917
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:19,291
-[Luna] <i>Abuelo!</i>
-[Memo, in Spanish] Are you okay?

918
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,125
Can you get up?

919
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:40,333
[in English] I'm so sorry, <i>abuelo.</i>
I didn't mean to push you.

920
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:43,958
I don't know what got into me.
I'm really sorry.

921
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:48,333
Hey, kids, come on.
We have to let him rest. <i>Vámonos.</i>

922
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,125
You must be Alex.

923
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,250
Chava told me about you.

924
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:01,166
He was very excited you were coming.

925
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,208
You, uh… You live in Cincinnati, right?

926
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:05,916
-Kansas City.
-[exhales]

927
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,208
You know, I went to school in Columbus.
It is very beautiful up there.

928
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:11,000
Is <i>abuelo </i>gonna be all right?

929
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:14,083
It's just a bump.
I gave him some medicine for the pain,

930
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:15,750
but he was very disoriented.

931
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:19,541
So how's his memory been?

932
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:20,916
It's perfect.

933
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,833
Well, he did go missing yesterday.

934
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:27,041
He likes to get exercise,
he just went for a walk.

935
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,458
You know, your <i>abuelo </i>is a strong man,

936
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:31,291
but his condition is just gonna get worse.

937
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:33,916
His farm is a lot for one man to care for.

938
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,416
He can do it.

939
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,416
Let's hope so.

940
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,708
[Chupa screeching]

941
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:44,958
[in Spanish] What was that?

942
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,833
[in English] It was a cow.

943
01:00:49,708 --> 01:00:51,583
That didn't sound like a cow.

944
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:55,041
It was a sick cow.

945
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:56,666
[Chupa screeching]

946
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,333
A very sick cow. [chuckles nervously]

947
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:01,458
He's okay.

948
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:03,833
That's why I never wanted
to be a veterinarian.

949
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,166
[in Spanish] Thank you so much.

950
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:08,125
Okay, <i>bueno. </i>Take care of your <i>abuelito.</i>

No, no! Stop! Chupa!

Stay back! It's dangerous.

962
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:31,916
He's not dangerous! Please, put that down!

963
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,625
Get out of the way!
You don't know what you're dealing with!

-No! Chupa, no! No!

-It's okay! It'll calm down!

-No!

968

[Quinn] There he goes.
He's gonna conk out.

-Let it take effect. [shushing]
-[Alex] No!

970
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:50,250
[sighs] Okay. Stay back!

-<i>Lo mataste!</i>
-How could you?

972
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,458
Relax. It's a mild sedative,
it's gonna be fine.

973
01:01:58,291 --> 01:02:01,000
Okay. I can't believe it.

It's gonna be okay. Calm down.

[Luna] It's okay.
We're gonna get him back.

982
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,291

No, no, no, I'm not Beto.
Beto's my dad. I'm Alex.

-Remember? Alex!
-What Alex? What Alex?

990
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,416
No time to explain.
Just put your shoes on.

No, I'm not going anywhere.
This is my house.

Who's Chupa?

01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:56,333
Chupa! The creature you found
on the side of the road. Remember Chupa?

Where are you taking him?

Don't worry about it. He's gonna be fine.

I told you, your enemy is on the loose.

-What now?
-I just have to grab this one.

1010

Very good, Chupa. Very good.

1206

Careful. Careful not to let him go,
please. Careful.

Easy! Don't let go of him.

-No! Chupa!
-No, no, no.

Listen to me, I've had it
up to here with all of you.

1226

Now that I got you,
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

1234

We have to do something!

No. There's nothing we can do, son.

1241

I'm sorry, Alex. We tried.

1242

This is just a… huge misunderstanding!

I don't want to hurt him.

Hey! Easy!

1270
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:28,041
You don't want to be zapped!

[grunting]

1273
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:40,541

Are you sad?

No, not really.

1306
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:22,333
He found his family. And I found mine.

Wanna go get some tacos?

1308
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:37,250

Do you feel like having more <i>sesos?</i>

You better.

1316
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:31,958
I made you this tape
with some cool Mexican bands.

1317
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,666
That way you can practice your Spanish.

1318
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,208
Thanks. I'll check it out
when I get back home.

1319
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:47,500
Take this, so you can
listen to it on the plane.

1320
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,625
Are you sure?

1321
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:54,708
I'm glad you came, <i>primo.</i>

[in Spanish] Where's Memo?
Where's he now? Memo!

1325

Come say goodbye to your cousin,

-No.

[in English] Never mind. Let's go.
I'll make sure he calls you when you land.

Very good, Alex.
That's right. Stay on top.

-Azul!
-[in English] Yeah!

[Mexican song playing on stereo]

1337
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:47,708
[in English] Can't wait to tell my mom
all about this trip.

1338
01:23:47,791 --> 01:23:50,458
[in Spanish] I had a lot of fun.
I loved Mexico.

[in Spanish] Don't stop
talking in Spanish, okay?

1342
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:59,000
[in English] Don't worry.
I'll practice with my mom.

1343
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:03,208
That's good.
Always be proud of who you are.

1344
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:06,500
-Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
-I won't.

1345
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:11,750
And if anyone tries to mess with me,
well, I know a few lucha libre moves.

1346
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:13,458
[chuckling] That's right.

1347
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:20,833
My dad was right.

1348
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:24,708
This place… really is magical.

Don't go wandering off
or anything like that.

[chuckles] I'll try my best.

1355
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:48,250
But your <i>primos </i>will take good care of me.

1356
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,458
Are you sad about leaving San Javier?

1357
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:53,958
Not really.
It's always good to be with family.

1358
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:57,958
Mexico City is a big city,
I'm afraid I might get lost in it.

1359
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:00,666
If you get lost,
your family will find you.

1360

[chuckles] You're right.

1361

my brain is not what it used to be.

1364
