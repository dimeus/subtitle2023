1
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:45,088
Just one sec.

2
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:46,698
Hasta El Fuego.
Please hold.

3
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:48,744
Okay.

4
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,137
This way.

5
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:56,708
Here you are.
Your server
will be right with you.

6
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:00,669
Hey, Jason.

7
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:01,887
Hey.

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,325
Hi. Do you know what you want?

9
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:05,413
- Uh, yeah.
- Cool.

10
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:06,805
Thanks.

11
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,071
Hi!

12
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:43,973
Um...

13
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:47,281
Okay.

14
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:49,500
- Another shot?
- Yeah, sure. Okay. Um...

15
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:54,940
Hi. Hi, Reggie.

16
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,203
<i>Laura, hi.</i>

17
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:59,510
Hello. <i>Um, so nice to phone-meet you</i>

18
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:01,164
<i>in this
incredibly embarrassing way.</i>

19
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:04,385
Oh, you know, no-- no problem.
It's fine.

20
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:07,518
<i>This is what I get
for picking a trendy place
with no sign out front, huh?</i>

21
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, why do they do that here? <i>I don't know.</i>

22
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,133
<i>I've only been in the city
for a few months.</i>

23
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,352
Me, too! No way! Yeah. <i>Oh, wow.</i>

24
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:18,094
Well, um,
it's a very cool restaurant.

25
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:20,618
Is it on Hudson? <i>Yes.</i>

26
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,186
<i>Am I on Hudson?</i> I don't know.

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,275
<i>I am not on Hudson. Shit.</i>

28
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,887
<i>Uh, I am now
walking towards Hudson.</i>

29
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,759
Okay. <i>I am so, so sorry.</i>

30
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,326
<i>This is not
the first impression
I wanted to make</i>

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,718
<i>on a college professor.</i>

32
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,590
Oh, pfft. Associate Professor,

33
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,679
and it's just
Film Studies, so...

34
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:39,637
<i>Oh.</i>...you're safe.

35
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:42,466
<i>Film Studies? That's...</i>
<i>...cool.</i>

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,817
You say that,
but try teaching a class
on 20th-century slashers

37
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,863
to a heap
of hungover 19-year-olds.

38
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:49,865
<i>Slashers, huh?</i>

39
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,128
<i>What's your favorite
scary movie?</i>

40
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,174
Um, not that one.

41
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,525
<i>So why slashers?</i>

42
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,875
Well, I just, you know,
I think it's interesting.

43
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,051
You can really examine
the culture of the moment

44
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,661
by looking at
the tropes of the time.

45
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:06,882
Like, um, the masked killer,
the final girl,

46
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,013
the different rules:

47
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,973
Don't split up. Don't have sex.

48
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:15,238
<i>Don't answer the phone.</i> Exactly, exactly, exactly.

49
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:16,761
It's all cliché.

50
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,633
But out of those clichés
comes an opportunity

51
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,330
for outsider art.

52
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,724
A voice for the voiceless,
you might say.

53
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,552
<i>Mmm.</i>
Jesus Christ.

54
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:26,771
<i>Yeah, I'm more of
a rom-com guy,
to be honest.</i>

55
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:29,470
<i>Okay, I think I'm on Hudson.</i>

56
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,080
Okay. <i>Um...</i>

57
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,908
<i>What color is the outside
of the restaurant?</i>

58
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,344
I-I think it's red.

59
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:37,478
<i>I don't see anything red.</i>

60
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:40,350
I, um-- I could be wrong.
Let me just, um...

61
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:42,396
Let me go have
a little look-see.

62
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,049
<i>Oh, okay. Thank you.</i>

63
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:47,531
All right, um...

64
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:50,447
Yep, it's definitely red.

65
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:53,668
<i>Yeah, I'm not seeing
anything red here.</i>

66
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,671
Sure you're on Hudson?

67
00:03:56,845 --> 00:04:00,196
<i>Um... Oh, crap,
I'm still a block over.</i>

68
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,329
<i>It looks like there's
an alley I can cut through.</i>

69
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:03,982
<i>Is the restaurant
near an alley?</i>

70
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,723
Um...

71
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,248
Yes! Yes.
There is an alley.

72
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:10,337
<i>Oh, perfect.
I'm coming down the alley.</i>

73
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,646
I don't see you.

74
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,562
<i>Wait. Really? Are you sure?</i>

75
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,129
Uh...

76
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,654
Let me just...

77
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:27,310
<i>Uh, there are some dumpsters
about halfway down.</i>

78
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,705
I see them,
but I don't see you.

79
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,490
<i>Yeah, I don't see you, either.</i>

80
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,928
<i>This is creepy, right?</i>

81
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:39,061
Uh, a little bit.

82
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,106
<i>20th-century slashers, huh?</i>

83
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,413
Yeah. Are you sure you're
walking towards Hudson?

84
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,110
<i>I'm sure.</i>

85
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,852
<i>Oh, wait, I think I see you!
Can you wave?</i>

86
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:49,811
Can you see me?

87
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:52,814
<i>Uh, the person I'm looking at
isn't waving.</i>

88
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:55,295
<i>They're just staring at me.</i>

89
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,166
Are you sure?

90
00:04:58,385 --> 00:04:59,690
<i>Okay, this is weird.</i>

91
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:04,304
<i>Um...
Now they're moving towards me.</i>

92
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:05,348
Are you okay?

93
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,350
<i>Shit. He's following me.</i>

94
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,178
I don't see anybody.

95
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:12,137
<i>Holy shit! He's after me!</i>

96
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,356
Where are you?

97
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,576
<i>He's got a knife!</i> What?

98
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,187
<i>And that's not the worst part.</i>

99
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,971
<i>The worst part is...</i>

100
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:22,147
<i>...you teach a class
about slashers</i>

101
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,194
<i>and you still walked
into a dark alley.</i>

102
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:26,500
<i>Alone.</i>

103
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:28,502
Okay, that's not funny.

104
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:33,550
<i>No.</i>

105
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:35,683
<i>It's not.</i>

106
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,761
Now I see something red.

107
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:07,209
Hey, girl, you look great!

108
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:15,739
You're not wearing
a costume? Come on.

109
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:18,394
No, I wouldn't
- have done that.
- Oh, hey. Tara!

110
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:19,874
Jason.

111
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,876
Are you and Greg gonna come
to the OKB party?

112
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,705
Well, if he finishes his
Spanish project in time,
yes, we will.

113
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,228
Is your sister coming?

114
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:27,969
No, Sam wouldn't be caught dead
at a frat party.

115
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:30,145
There's a first time
for everything.

116
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,103
Not tonight, though.

117
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,976
- Can't convince her?
- No. That's not my problem,
that's yours.

118
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,457
- Save me a drink!
- All right.
I'll see you.

119
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:51,906
Honey, I'm home!

120
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:57,564
Greg?

121
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:01,306
Greg?

122
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,124
I'm sorry, okay?

123
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,865
I--

124
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,216
I just got massive blue balls,
and I-- I had to practice.

125
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,914
Please don't be mad.
How mad are you?

126
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,702
<i>Oh, I'm not mad, Jason.</i>

127
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,225
Dude.

128
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,357
We said we wouldn't
use the voice on each other.

129
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,839
<i>We said a lot of things.</i>

130
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,928
This is Greg, right?

131
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,977
<i>Who else would it be?</i>

132
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:05,762
Where are you?
I want to tell you about it.

133
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,329
Oh, by the way,

134
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:10,114
we should go to that frat party.
Tara's going.

135
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:12,682
<i>What was it like?</i> Not on the phone, man.

136
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:15,424
Seriously, turn off
the fucking voice modulator.

137
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,818
<i>I'm just trying
to get the voice right.</i>

138
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,864
<i>You got to have your practice,
I get mine.</i>

139
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,431
Whatever.

140
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:25,086
<i>Just tell me
what it felt like.</i>

141
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:27,567
<i>Then maybe I'll come out.</i>

142
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,133
Dude, I know
you're not here.

143
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:31,396
<i>Humor me.</i>

144
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,137
All right, fine.

145
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,707
It was even better

146
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:40,101
than we ever could have imagined.

147
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,018
I mean,
when the knife went in her,

148
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:48,718
it's like
she wasn't human anymore.

149
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,633
Just an animal.

150
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:56,117
And every time it went in,

151
00:09:56,291 --> 00:10:00,556
she was less and less human.

152
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:03,515
And then,

153
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,258
she was just meat.

154
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:10,653
<i>But she wasn't just meat, Jason.</i>

155
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,656
<i>She was a person.
Our film professor.</i>

156
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,918
Yeah, well,

157
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,008
fuck her.

158
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,752
She gave me a C-minus
on my giallo paper.

159
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:26,190
<i>Is that why you killed her?
Because of the C-minus?[sighs]</i>

160
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:29,193
<i>Who's next, your grade-school
vice principal?</i>

161
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:30,847
You know who's next.

162
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,283
Why are you
being like this?

163
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,372
<i>Come on, Jason.</i>

164
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,679
<i>How long
have we known each other?</i>

165
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,641
You tell me.

166
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,863
<i>Eight years.</i>

167
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:49,561
<i>We met in junior high.
In Atlanta.</i>

168
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:53,565
<i>I just want you to tell me
why you think
you're doing this.</i>

169
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,741
<i>In your words.</i>

170
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:56,351
We're finishing
Richie's film.

171
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,832
<i>That's right,
by killing Sam and Tara.</i>

172
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,355
Why are you fucking with me?

173
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:03,053
Why won't you tell me
where you are?

174
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:06,143
<i>Why do you keep asking me that?
I already told you.</i>

175
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,058
<i>I'm here.</i>

176
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:13,411
<i>Let's play a game.</i>[sighs] Shit.

177
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,283
<i>Do you know Warmer, Colder?</i>

178
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:17,502
<i>Come on, find me.</i>

179
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,896
<i>And then we'll go and cut up
the Carpenter sisters.</i>

180
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,116
Are you using
the fucking cameras?

181
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,900
<i>Yeah. The cameras.</i>

182
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:27,948
<i>And at the moment,
you're very, very cold.</i>

183
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,906
All right, douchebag,
let's play.

184
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,350
<i>Cold.</i>

185
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,662
<i>Heating up.</i>

186
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,408
<i>Warmer.</i>

187
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,542
<i>Warmer.</i>

188
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,822
All right, you know what?
This is stupid.

189
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:17,171
I'm gonna hang up now.

190
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,868
<i>But you're getting warmer.</i>

191
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,092
<i>Colder.</i>

192
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:33,535
<i>Warmer.</i>

193
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,581
<i>Warmer.</i>

194
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,628
<i>You're on fire!</i>

195
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,023
Oh, fuck!

196
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,074
Do you feel
like an animal, Jason?

197
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:55,383
Please, stop!

198
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,257
Like meat?

199
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:05,480
But we have
to finish the movie.

200
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:07,438

So how are the new meds
treating you?

217
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:45,912
Okay, I think.

218
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:49,437
Still not seeing anyone
I shouldn't be.

219
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,614
What I'm really worried about,
though, is Tara.

220
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:55,660
What I'm really
worried about is you.

221
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,272
You've been coming here
for six months now,

222
00:13:58,446 --> 00:13:59,926
and all we've
really spoken about

223
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,493
is how your sister
isn't dealing with

224
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,278
whatever happened
to both of you

225
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:05,801
a year ago.

226
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:08,064
Now, you've alluded
to an abusive relationship,

227
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:10,893
issues with your father,

228
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:16,464
but every time I push you
for specifics, you shut down.

229
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,163
I have trust issues.

230
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:21,904
Okay.

231
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,168
If I'm going
to help you,

232
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:29,346
um, I-- I need you to
give me the details.

233
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:35,483
Okay.

234
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,753
My father was Billy Loomis.

235
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,103
He was a famous serial killer.

236
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,976
They made a movie about him.

237
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,892
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Certainly did.

238
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:54,284
Last year I found out

239
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,765
that my boyfriend
was also a serial killer

240
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,072
and only dating me
because he idolized my father.

241
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:01,291
- Uh-huh.
- Him and his psycho girlfriend

242
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:02,814
killed a bunch of people.

243
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,773
And when it got out
that I'm Billy's daughter,

244
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,601
this crazy rumor started online

245
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,951
that I orchestrated
the whole thing and framed them.

246
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:18,482
Huh?

247
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:20,484
Richie was my boyfriend.

248
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,535
But you didn't.

249
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,799
- Of course not.
- Okay.

250
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,540
He almost killed my sister

251
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:33,758
and me,

252
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:35,978
before I stopped him.

253
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,588
Okay, and how...

254
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,851
How-how did you stop him?

255
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:43,029
Well, I stabbed him 22 times
and slit his throat.

256
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:45,814
And then I shot him
in the head.

257
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,251
But that's not why I'm here.

258
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,646
Why are you here?

259
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:54,388
Because...

260
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:00,394
it felt right.

261
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:09,403
I... [clears throat] Uh...
I think we're done here.

262
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:13,755
What? No, you said
give you details. I'm just--

263
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:16,932
I-- I'm not equipped
to deal with this kind of thing.

264
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,891
Please, Dr. Stone.
I'm asking for your help.

265
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,677
By law, I'm required
to report this
to the authorities.

266
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,809
Report it? Report what?

267
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,724
I didn't say
I was gonna do anything.

268
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,813
Not explicitly, no.

269
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,076
You know what?

270
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,121
Forget it.

271
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:35,385
You're just like all the others.

272
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,020
<i>Hey, you've reached Tara.
Why aren't you texting me?</i>

273
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:04,197
You know you're supposed
to pick up when I call.

274
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:07,722
I got out of therapy early,
so I was thinking
maybe we cook dinner tonight.

275
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:10,812
If you want.
I'll see you soon.

276
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,564
Hey!

277
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,614
Tara?

278
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,113
Oh, yeah.

279
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,723
Quinn?

280
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,899
Oh, shit.[Quinn's lover] Come on!

281
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:57,685
Were we being too loud?

282
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:00,514
Not at all.
Have you seen Tara?

283
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:01,906
Um...

284
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,343
Don't be mad.

285
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,214
- Why would I be mad?
- Because you get mad.

286
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:07,390
Is that Paul?

287
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,871
Who the fuck is Paul?

288
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,569
Life, I have found,

289
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,919
is about variety.

290
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:20,795
Okay.

291
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,190
- Uh, this one's yours.
- Thanks.

292
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:25,582
Where's Tara?

293
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,845
She went
to the Omega Kappa Beta party.

294
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,717
I begged her
not to go to that!

295
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,327
And we've now arrived
at mad.

296
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,288
Do you know if she at least
took her Taser?

297
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:38,900
I cannot speak
to how heavily armed Tara is

298
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,858
at this fraternity party.

299
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,342
Babe, you coming back?"Babe"?

300
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:47,517
I don't know.

301
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:55,569
Ooh,
is Cute Boy shirtless again?

302
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:59,790
- Who's Cute Boy, babe?
- Always you... sweetie.

303
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:02,010
You guys have been checking
each other out for months.

304
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,533
Why don't you just
talk to him?

305
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,144
Because that right there

306
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,015
is about all the romantic
interaction I'm ready for.

307
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,060
- I'm gonna go find Tara.
- Okay.

308
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,758
- Be right back.
- Bye.

309

It doesn't bother you?

Being at a house party
after you were almost

brutally murdered
at a house party?

324

No, I think of it
like being struck by lightning.

The odds of it

330
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,168
Hi.

00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:15,910
How are you doing, T?

332
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,128
Hi.

333
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:19,479
You're lying.

No, last one's kicked.

335
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,570
We got some hard stuff
in the kitchen, though.

336
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:26,573
Frankie.

337
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:28,444
Tara.

338
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:30,751
Lead the way.

339
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:33,101
You Omega Beta Zeta?

340
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,538
No, not yet.
But I might rush it.

341
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:38,280
Oh, freshman. Right on!

342
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,327
Where from?

343
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,634
Michigan.

344
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:45,983
All right.

345
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:47,768
You know what?

346
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:50,249
I got a bottle of Fireball
up in my room.

347
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,429
Fuck it. Yeah, go.

348
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:00,868
- Uh... Oh, I don't love that.
- Mm-mmm.

349
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,045

You want to call it a night?

350

No, uh...

I think that I'm actually
still gonna hang,

352
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,138
but you guys don't have
to wait for me.

353
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,140
Don't worry.
I'll take care of her.

354
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,576
I'm Frankie.

355
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,752
And I'm spectacularly uninterested

356
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,493
in knowing
anything about you.

357
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,368
No, dude, Anika,
I'm not that bad.

358
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:25,545
But I appreciate you
looking out for me.

359
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:32,247
Let me see it in your face.
Mmm. Mmm.

360
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:35,250
- Closer. Closer. Ooh. Uh.
- Ooh.

361
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:36,469
All right, all right.

362
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:38,209
Cheers, man,
to the dynamic duo

363
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:41,778
of Hortense Tower,
third floor, room 315.

364
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:43,258
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

365
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:48,611
Oh, man.
Time to start making moves.

366
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,874
Yeah, get you out there.
Introduce you to some girls!

367
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:52,136
What about her?

368
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,748
She's gorgeous.

369
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:56,402
- Great. Ask her out.
- No, I can't.

370
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:58,099
Ask her out. Ask her out.

371
00:21:58,273 --> 00:21:59,622
Shut up!

372
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,145
Got to have confidence.
Plus, look at you, man!

373
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,625
You're a snack!

374
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,801
Practically an entire meal
all on your own.

375
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,934
- Really?
- Yeah. You're Ethan Landry.

376
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:08,370
Hey, excuse me!

377
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:10,503
- Chad.
- Howdy. How you doing?

378
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:13,070
My friend here,
he's a snack, right?

379
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:18,946
- What did that mean?
- No, it's good.

380
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,121
- What?
- It's not bad.

381
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:21,427
There's room for improvement!

382
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,342
Hey, big guy, you're needed.

383
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,606
See ya.

384
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,999
Aren't you that girl involved
in that "Stab" shit

385
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:30,610
in California last year?

386
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,090
No.
That's a different pirate.

387
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:34,831
Hey, partner!

388
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,443
Tara's good down here.

389
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:39,749
Sorry, bro,
I didn't catch that.

390
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:42,970
Yeah, you did.

391
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:44,319
No, Chad.

392
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:48,149
- It's fine. I want to.
- Yeah, see, Chad?

393
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:50,499
- It's okay.
- She wants to.

394
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:52,240
Come on.[winces] Ow!

395
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:56,287
- Get your fucking hands off her.
- Get the fuck off me!

396
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,680
Guys!

397
00:22:57,854 --> 00:22:59,769
Who the fuck are you,
<i>Risky Business?</i>

398
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:01,292
Stop![Sam] Guys, guys!

399
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:02,816
Sorry to interrupt.

400
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,731
I'm just gonna tase you
in the balls real quick.

401
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,170
Don't ever lay hands
on my sister.

402
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,390
You fucking bitch!

403
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,304
Sam.[Frankie] Fuck you!

404
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,871
Are you fucking kidding me?

405
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:16,525
You're stalking me now?

406
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,137
Holy shit,
it's that psycho girl!

407
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,401
That's her?

408
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:27,101
Tara. Will you stop?

409
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,059
I cannot believe you did that!
You embarrassed me.

410
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,321
That guy was a dick.

411
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:31,366
He was gonna
take advantage of you.

412
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,672
- So?
- So?

413
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,021
If I want to hook up
with an asshole,

414
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,588
that's my decision!

415
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:37,764
- It's my decision.
- Okay.

416
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,156
It's not about you!

417
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,810
You're out of my life
for five years,

418
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,986
and then you can't
leave me alone for five minutes.

419
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,772
Because you're not dealing
with what happened to us.

420
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,643
Have you even gone
to see the counselor once?

421
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:49,515
No, I'm not going to.[Sam] Why not?

422
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:52,605
Because I'm uninterested in
living in the past like you are.

423
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,476
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Guys, come on.

424
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,305
It means I'm not gonna let what
happened to us for three days

425
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,481
define the rest of my life.

426
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:02,223
So you're just gonna
pretend it never happened.

427
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:05,444
What are you doing here, Sam?
In New York.

428
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:08,142
You're working two shitty jobs
to help with rent, whatever,

429
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,883
but what's your plan?

430
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,060
I know what I'm gonna do.

431
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,323
Okay? Because I'm gonna
keep going to college,

432
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:18,239
I'm gonna get my degree,
and I'm gonna live my life.

433
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:19,980
My life.

434
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,112
Okay? I know.

435
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,811
You just followed me here,

436
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:26,726
and you won't let me
out of your sight.

437
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:30,643
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

438
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:32,819
I--

439
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:33,950
I know.

440
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:35,430
I know you are.

441
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:39,390
You can't do it
for the rest of my life, though.

442
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,481
You have to let me go.

443
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:45,135
Hey!

444
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,660
Murderer!

445
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,879
What the fuck is wrong
with you, bitch?

446
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:51,141
You got a problem with me?

447
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:52,795
You guys should stay away
from her.

448
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,058
- She knows what she did.
- I didn't fucking do anything!

449
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:56,625
Sure, bitch.

450
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,626
Walk away!

451
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,323
I'm so sick of this shit.

452
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,456
Hey, calm down. Come on.

453
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,980

if you want tissues.

454
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,375

three tissues.

that you're covered
in Cherry Coke.

523
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,288
Um, I'm pretty sure
it's Diet Cherry Coke, actually.

524
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:30,290
- Oh.
- What, you don't like it?

525
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:32,727
No, I love it! I do.

526
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:36,078
It's a very sensual,
aromatic choice.

527
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,344
Was that another
conspiracy nut?

528
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:44,304
Being famous
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

529
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,830
And Tara's pissed at me.
- Again.
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:51,398
She says she wants me
to let her go.

531
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,575
Yeah, family can be rough.

532
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:56,098
Sam!

533
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:58,579
Get up here right now!

534
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:00,886
<i>I'm standing in front
of the apartment building...</i>

535
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,801
What's going on? <i>...where the mutilated bodies</i>

536
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:04,759
<i>of two students...</i> Cute Boy. Nice.

537
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:06,413
<i>...were discovered.</i>

538
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:08,763
<i>Their names have just
been released by police.</i>

539
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,417
<i>Jason Carvey
and Greg Bruckner.</i>

540
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:12,898
Holy shit, that's that chode
from our Film Studies class!

541
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:15,204
The one obsessed with Argento. <i>Also found at the scene</i>

542
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:17,511
<i>were various
Ghostface costumes,</i>

543
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:21,776
<i>a character popularized
by theStab movie franchise.</i>

544
00:30:22,646 --> 00:30:24,474
Pack a bag.
We leave in ten.

545
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:25,911
Sam! Wait, Sam!

546
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:27,651
- We're getting out of the city.
- What?

547
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,871
Thank you, suspicious new guy,
but we got it from here.

548
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,612
Have a good night.
Get home safe.

549
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,353
Go, go, go.

550
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:34,789
Sam!

551
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:35,877
Sam, wh--

552
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,618
Hold on.
- Come on.

553
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,055
No, wait, let's talk
about this for a second.

554
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:41,840
'Cause this might not
have anything to do with us.

555
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:43,929
- Are you serious?
- It's a big city!

556
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:45,669
It's Halloween.
Everybody's wearing masks!

557
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,324
- You don't know.
- Tara,
this isn't a coincidence.

558
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:51,110
- You knew him!
- Barely.

559
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:52,502
Chad, Mindy, back me up.

560
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:55,549
It is a little bit... Close to home.

561
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:57,594
See?

562
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,859
Quinn, your dad's a cop, right?

563
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,948
Can you call him
and find out what's going on?

564
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:04,688
Before you make
the unilateral decision

565
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,691
to abandon my college education
and flee the fucking state!

566
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,303
- I'm calling him now.
- Thank you.

567
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:21,227
Who is it?

568
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:28,321
Why did everyone just freak out
when her phone rang?

569
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:29,626
You got to keep up, my dude.

570
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,106
Sam?

571
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,326
My dad wants to talk to you.

572
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,459
Mr. Bailey, hi.[Mr. Bailey] <i>Hey, Sam.</i>

573
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:39,201
I was actually just about
to call you.

574
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,987
<i>Well, my sister thinks
I'm probably overreacting.</i>

575
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:44,380
No, unfortunately, you're not.

576
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:46,513
<i>What do you mean?
What's going on?</i>

577
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:50,343
I'm afraid I need you
to come down to the station.

578
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,698
Sam, slow down.

579
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,700
Tara, no.
Get back inside, lock the door.

580
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:00,962
Are you serious?

581
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,355
Now you don't want
to stick together?

582
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,010
Fine.

583
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:18,849
What the fuck?

584
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:22,244
I never deleted his contact.

585
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:24,768
This is coming
- from his number.
- Don't pick that up.

586
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:26,901
Just let it ring.

587
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:29,556
Sam.

588
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,951
Who is this?
<i>Hello, Samantha.</i>

589
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,474
<i>Did you miss me?</i>

590
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:35,910
I want you to think
long and hard

591
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,477
about whether you really
want to do this.

592
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:39,435
Because the last two people
that fucked with us

593
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:40,915
ended up dead.

594
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:43,526
<i>You should be thanking me, Sam.</i>

595
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,182
<i>Jason and Greg were gonna
kill you and your sister.</i>

596
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:51,143
<i>I gutted them
before they had the chance.</i>

597
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,760
So what?
You're protecting us now?

598
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,457
<i>Not quite.</i>

599
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,764
<i>I'm going to show the world
who you really are:</i>

600
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:05,722
<i>A liar and a killer.</i>

601
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:08,377
<i>I'm going to punish you, Sam.</i>

602
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:11,119
You shouldn't believe
everything you read
on the Internet, asshole.

603
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:13,687
<i>Don't be cute.
You're gonna pay
for what you did.</i>

604
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:16,298
<i>And I'm not gonna stop
until I butcher you.</i>

605
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:18,387
<i>You and anyone
who gets between us.</i>

606
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,607
<i>You and Tara
better watch your backs.</i>

607
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,609
You better watch yours.

608
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:26,047
No! No!

609
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,223
Run!

610
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:30,530
Come on!

611
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:33,359
- Help! Please!
- In there!

612
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,711
Please help us!

613
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:39,365
- We were just attacked.
- Call 911!

614
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,802
There's a fucking line here,
girls.

615
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,847
I'm telling you, sir.
Could you--

616
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:46,720
You got a problem here, guy?

617
00:33:58,601 --> 00:33:59,994
Hey!

618
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,398
- Go out the back!
- Thank you!

619
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:17,577
Fuck, it's locked.
- Keys! We need your keys!

620
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,581
- Look out!
- Watch out!

621
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:27,761
Wait.

622
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,763
Wait, wait! No, no, no!

623
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:09,732
Run! Go! Run!

624
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:17,740
Let's go.[officer 2] Going round back.

625
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:46,204
This was found next to the body
at the apartment crime scene.

626
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:51,078
DNA says that it belonged
to someone named Richie Kirsch.

627
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,429
Does that ring a bell?

628
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:58,172
We're familiar
with him.

629
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:00,522
But the one that attacked us
had a different mask on.

630
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:03,656
It was kind of more beat up.
Like it was older.

631
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,006
Uh...

632
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,399
I got to ask...

633
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:10,184
do you have alibis
for earlier tonight?

634
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:12,621
I was at a party
with my friends.

635
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:14,710
I was at my therapist's.

636
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:17,670
I can give you his information.
You can call to check
if you want.

637
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,585
And then I met Tara
at that party,

638
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:21,326
where I tased someone.

639
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:23,415
Unrelated.

640
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:26,418
Was that before
or after this happened?

641
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:27,984
<i>Murderer!</i>

642
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:29,638
<i>What the fuck
is wrong with you, bitch?</i>

643
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:32,032
<i>You got a problem with me?</i> Before.

644
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:34,295
The point is,
we were with people all night.

645
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:37,080
So, our roommate's dad

646
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,387
just happened
to pull our case.

647
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:41,389
That'd be a crazy coincidence, right?

648
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:43,696
- Yeah.
- The detective who had the case,

649
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,481
he offered it to me
because it involves Quinn.

650
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:49,658
Um, but I can totally give it
back if you're uncomfortable.

651
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:50,964
It's up to you.

652
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,578
It's fine.

653
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:59,364
So if the man who attacked you
did steal your license

654
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:00,974
and plant it next to the body,

655
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:04,369
it'd probably be somebody
close to you.

656
00:38:05,631 --> 00:38:07,415
How long have you known
your friends?

657
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:08,982
Well, we moved here
with Mindy and Chad

658
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,723
for summer semester,
like, six months ago.

659
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:16,424
So, Quinn, um, Ethan, Anika--
all since then.

660
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:20,385
I think I can vouch for Quinn,
so that's one less
we have to worry about.

661
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:23,736
Do either of you have anyone
that might want to target you?

662
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,305
Not anyone
who's still alive.

663
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:29,742
Yikes.

664
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:32,919
FBI's here,
claiming jurisdiction.

665
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:34,137
Where are they?

666
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:41,667
Can I help you?

667
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:46,802
Special Agent Kirby Reed, FBI.

668
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:48,587
I work out
of the Atlanta office.

669
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:49,979
Oh. You lost?

670
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:53,287
Your two vics
were residents of my city

671
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:54,854
before they moved here
for college.

672
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:56,986
I have been investigating
their online activity

673
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,684
for the past few months.

674
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:01,730
Wow.

675
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:03,297
Why?

676
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:06,039
I take a special interest
in Ghostface attacks.

677
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:07,954
- Kirby?
- Hey, Sam.

678
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:10,348
What?

679
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:12,045
Tara.

680
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:14,700
You're the FBI?Mm-hmm.

681
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,963
- You guys know each other?
- Yeah.

682
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:18,660
We went
to Woodsboro High together.

683
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,749
She was a senior
when I was a freshman.

684
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:23,012
We share a certain history, yeah.

685
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:25,275
I'm not trying
to get into

686
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,973
a jurisdictional
pissing contest here,

687
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,540
I just want to help.

688
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,934
I'll show you mine,
et cetera.

689
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,285
Thank you.

690
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:37,984
He left this mask
at the bodega.

691
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:40,203
DNA traces of two individuals,

692
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,989
Charlie Walker, Jill Roberts,
both deceased.

693
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,601
The Ghostface killers of 2011.

694
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:50,039
Charlie Walker gave me this.

695
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:52,302
Like I said,
I take a special interest.

696
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:55,001
Is this the mask he was wearing
when he attacked you?

697
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:57,003
No.

698
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:59,048
So he's leaving them
on purpose.

699
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:00,659
Which means whoever's doing this

700
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,878
is a student of the killers
who came before.

701
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:04,097
Maybe he believes

702
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,229
Sam is the latest
in a long line.

703
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,755
Yeah, good luck with that.
We're getting out of town.

704
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,322
I'm sorry,
that's not possible.

705
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:15,151
You're both persons of interest
in a double homicide,

706
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,197
so you're not allowed
to leave town. Sorry.

707
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:19,591
- Are you serious?
- He's right.

708
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:22,202
But if we work together--We're going.

709
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:30,340
Samantha, do you have an alibi
for last night's murders?

710
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:32,342
Tara, do you feel safe
around your sister?

711
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,562
Tara! Tara!

712
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:36,477
Gale Weathers, Channel 4.

713
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:38,958
Do you ladies
think you're the reason

714
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:41,003
the Ghostface killer
has come to the Big Apple?

715
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:48,097
Nice try, sweetie,
but I've done this dance before.

716
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:53,929
Stay away from us.

717
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:55,627
Are you still mad at me?

718
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:58,238
You said you wouldn't write
a book about what happened.

719
00:40:58,412 --> 00:40:59,979
And then you wrote a book
about what happened.

720
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:01,241
Oh, come on.

721
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,721
Somebody was gonna write
about it!

722
00:41:02,895 --> 00:41:04,244
It's what I do.

723
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:05,898
I heard you couldn't sell
the movie rights.

724
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:09,554
It's all about true-crime
limited series these days.

725
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:11,599
After everything
we went through together.

726
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,036
What would Dewey think?

727
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,823
- That's a low blow.
- So was your book.

728
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:20,956
You called me "unstable"
and a "born killer."

729
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,307
- That's taken out of context.
- That's literally a quote.

730
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,048
You don't think
what you wrote
has something to do

731
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:28,007
with what's happening to us?

732
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:30,096
Come on.

733
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,054
Hey, I talked to Sidney.

734
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:37,059
She's not coming here,
- is she?
- No.

735
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:38,626
She sends her love,

736
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,237
but she's taking Mark
and the kids someplace safe.

737
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:43,588
She deserves
to have her happy ending.

738
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:46,982
On that much, we agree.

739
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,899
Hey, I want to catch this fucker
as much as you do!

740
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:52,292
Maybe.

741
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:53,728
Or maybe you're just afraid

742
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:55,164
that without Ghostface
in your life,

743
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:56,905
you're gonna fade away.

744
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:06,175
<i>You fools! You're in danger!</i>

745
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:09,135
<i>Can't you see?
They're after you!</i>

746
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:11,354
<i>They're after all of us!
Our wives,</i>

747
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,008
<i>our children, everyone!</i>

748
00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:16,490
<i>They're here already!
You're next!</i>

749
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:21,626
<i>You're next! You're next!
You're next!</i>

750
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,192
<i>You're next!</i>

751
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,202
Who is it?

752
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:53,222
You're a day early
for trick-or-treating, you know.

753
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:31,304
<i>♪ Take a little walk
To the edge of town♪</i>

754
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:33,349
<i>♪ And go across the tracks... ♪</i>

755
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:36,004
Okay, nerds,
listen up!

756
00:43:36,178 --> 00:43:38,093
As terrifying
as this all is,

757
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:40,530
I'm actually glad
I get a chance to redeem myself

758
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:43,098
for not calling the killers
last time.

759
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:45,884
- Yep.
- It's fine. Okay.

760
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:49,496
The way I see it, someone is out
to make a sequel to the requel.

761
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,324
Um, what's a requel?

762
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:54,457
You're beautiful, sweetie.
Let's hold questions to the end.

763
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,677
<i>Stab 1</i> took place
in Woodsboro.

764
00:43:56,851 --> 00:43:59,332
<i>Stab 2</i> took place in college.

765
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:01,682
So we think that
the killer is trying
to copy the movies?

766
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:03,292
That is one possibility.

767
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:05,512
Heroes now in college:
Check.

768
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:08,341
Suspicious new characters
brought in
to round out the suspect list

769
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:11,605
and/or body count:
Check, check and check.
I don't like this.

770
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:13,389
But it can't just be
about <i>Stab 2.</i>

771
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:15,261
- Why not?
- It would make sense

772
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:16,828
if this were just a sequel.

773
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:18,307
But we're not in a sequel,

774
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:20,658
because nobody
just makes sequels anymore.

775
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,749
We're in a franchise!

776
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:28,317
And there are certain rules
to a continuing franchise.

777
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:30,450
- I had a feeling.
- Rule one:

778
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:32,147
Everything is bigger
than last time.

779
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:35,150
Bigger budget, bigger cast,
bigger body count.

780
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:37,065
Longer chases, shoot-outs, beheadings.

781
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:39,111
You got to top what came before
to keep people coming back.

782
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:41,200
- Beheadings?
- Beheadings.

783
00:44:41,374 --> 00:44:44,725
Rule two:
Whatever happened last time,
expect the opposite.

784
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:47,772
Franchises only survive
by subverting expectations.

785
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:50,949
If the killers last time
were whiny snowflake film nerds

786
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,994
with Letterboxd accounts
instead of personalities,

787
00:44:53,168 --> 00:44:55,780
you can bet
the opposite will be true here.

788
00:44:55,954 --> 00:44:59,261
And rule three:
No one is safe.

789
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:02,177
Legacy characters?
Cannon fodder at this point.

790
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:04,179
Usually brought back
only to be killed off

791
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:06,399
in some cheap bid
for nostalgia.

792
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:09,097
It's not looking too good
for Gale and Kirby.

793
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:11,360
Oh, and that's
not even the worst part!

794
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,493
This is the part where she
tells us the worst part.

795
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,713
The worst part is

796
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:20,282
franchises are just
continuing episodic installments
designed to boost an IP.

797
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:22,589
Which means main characters

798
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,852
are completely expendable now, too.

799
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:28,290
Laurie Strode, Nancy Thompson,
Ellen Ripley,

800
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:31,206
Sally Hardesty, Jigsaw,
Tony Stark, James Bond--

801
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,034
I mean, even Luke Skywalker--

802
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,776
all died so their franchises
could live on.

803
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,170
That means it's not
just the friend group.

804
00:45:38,344 --> 00:45:41,086
Any of us could go
at any time,

805
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:43,697
especially Sam and Tara.

806
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,962
Wait, any of us?[Mindy] Yeah.

807
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:50,748
Am I in the friend group?[Mindy] Yeah.

808
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:53,359
Am I, like,
one of the targets?[Mindy] Mm-hmm.

809
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:56,057
Am I gonna die a virgin?

810
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,365
That was a weird overshare.

811
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:01,715
But it brings us
to our current suspects:

812
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:03,456
Ethan.

813
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,066
The shy, dorky guy
who no one suspects

814
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,938
because he's so shy and dorky.

815
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:08,678
Why am I
on the suspect list?

816
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:11,029
Because I'm randomly
Chad's roommate?

817
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:12,944
Roommate lotteries
can be juked.

818
00:46:13,118 --> 00:46:15,163
You could have fixed it
to get next to us.

819
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:16,425
Quinn.

820
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:17,905
The slutty roommate.

821
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,733
A horror movie...
...classic.

822
00:46:19,907 --> 00:46:22,562
"Sex positive,"
but... thank you?

823
00:46:22,736 --> 00:46:25,695
Mm-hmm. Um, how did you come
to live with Sam and Tara?

824
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,002
I answered their ad online.

825
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:29,395
Okay, say no more.

826
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:31,484
You've already implicated
yourself enough.

827
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:33,225
It was an anonymous ad, Mindy.

828
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:35,488
And you know we vetted her.
Plus her dad is a cop.

829
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:37,577
And that makes it more likely
that she's the killer,

830
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:39,231
because having a cop dad
is a great cover.

831
00:46:39,405 --> 00:46:41,711
Do you not remember
how these movies work, Tara?

832
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:44,149
Is she always like this?

833
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:46,368
And finally... Anika.

834
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:50,590
Never trust the love interest.

835
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:57,553
Okay! So, we have our rules
and we have our suspects.

836
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:59,338
But wait.
What about you guys?

837
00:46:59,512 --> 00:47:02,732
I mean, I think it's pretty safe
to rule out the four of us

838
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:04,996
who went through this last year
in Woodsboro.

839
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,215
- Agreed.
- Um, not agreed.

840
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:09,609
What if the trauma
you all went through

841
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:12,525
caused one
or more of you to snap?

842
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:16,398
Yeah, or the fame you got
from the killings
made you thirsty for more.

843
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:18,009
I mean, let's be honest here,

844
00:47:18,183 --> 00:47:20,446
some of the theories online
about Sam are--

845
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,056
Don't you fucking dare.

846
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,885
Okay, she's right, though.

847
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:26,278
I mean, face facts--

848
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:28,323
if we're all suspects,
you're all suspects.

849
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:41,684
Remember Samantha Carpenter's
- alibi, the therapist?
- Mm-hmm.

850
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,905
He was stabbed
- to death. Through the nose.
- Mmm.

851
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,299
Through the nose.
How messed up is that?

852
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:49,518
It's pretty messed up.

853
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:52,347
He turned her in
for making threatening remarks,

854
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:53,827
ended up dead.

855
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:56,090
And guess which patient's
notes were stolen?

856
00:47:57,657 --> 00:48:00,878
So Sam kills her own alibi and
steals her own session notes?

857
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:02,096
Maybe.

858
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:04,707
Another mask
was found at the scene.

859
00:48:05,665 --> 00:48:07,362
It's a DNA match
for Roman Bridger.

860
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:10,322
The Ghostface
who was directing <i>Stab 3.</i>

861
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:14,892
It's like he's leaving us
real-life franchise Easter eggs.

862
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:18,634
Like dropping
the killers' masks in reverse.

863
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:21,333
Almost like he's counting down
to something.

864
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:24,031
What happens
when he gets to one?

865
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,039
So we've had nine
Ghostface killers so far.

866
00:48:32,213 --> 00:48:33,606
Nine. I thought in the movies--

867
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,043
Forget about the movies.
The movies don't matter.

868
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:39,655
Look. Last year was
Amber Freeman and Richie Kirsch,

869
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:41,614
whose masks we found
at the first crime scene

870
00:48:41,788 --> 00:48:44,008
along with the bodies
of two film students

871
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:46,836
who killed their professor
earlier that same night.

872
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:49,883
Then it was Jill Roberts
and Charlie Walker--

873
00:48:50,057 --> 00:48:51,319
theirs at the bodega.

874
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:53,843
Roman Bridger was the only
single Ghostface.

875
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:55,236
Kudos to him for ambition.

876
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,717
His mask
was found at the shrink's.

877
00:48:57,891 --> 00:49:01,373
Which leaves Mickey Altieri,
Nancy Loomis, Stu Macher...

878
00:49:01,547 --> 00:49:03,853
...and Billy Loomis. Number one.

879
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:05,943
And the father
of our chief suspect.

880
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:10,686
Well, whoever's doing this
is leading us back to Sam.

881
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:15,996
I will check in later.

882
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,172
And tell your daughter
to stay sharp.

883
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:21,393
Proximity to the Carpenters
is proximity to Ghostface.

884
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:34,014
Hey, Jack? Would you call
the Atlanta field office?

885
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:36,974
Dig up what you can
on Agent Reed.

886
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,460
I think you should
get out of the city.

887
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:48,289
You know, considering
what happened to you
last time.

888
00:49:48,463 --> 00:49:53,077
I-- I wouldn't blame you
if... you wanted to go.

889
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:58,169
That's very thoughtful of you,
but, um,

890
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:01,085
I don't think
I'm going anywhere.

891
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:04,479
Will you two
just make out already?

892
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:07,004
That is so inappropriate,
- dude.
- Oh, whatever.

893
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:08,701
Get it over with!

894
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:09,789
Here you go.

895
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:11,530
Sam?[Sam] Yep?

896
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:13,662
We do not
have to stay here.

897
00:50:13,836 --> 00:50:16,622
Well, too bad. I insist.
Safety in numbers.

898
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:18,145
This'll be so fun.

899
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,973
A little slumber party
with the Core Four!

900
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:21,496
- "Core Four"?
- Yeah.

901
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,324
- Did you give us a nickname?
- I sure did.

902
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:24,760
We've been through
a lot together,

903
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:26,501
and it's a pretty cool nickname.

904
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:28,329
- That's debatable.
- It's extremely debatable.

905
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:30,244
You can't just give yourself
a nickname, dingus.

906
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:32,638
Of course I can, dingus,
because I just did.

907
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,770
- Core Four, up top!
- No.

908
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:36,207
- Down low.
- Get that away from me.

909
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,513
Please,
- for the love of God.
- Don't do it.

910
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:41,212
I would like a little more
respect and support

911
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:43,605
from my fellow members
of the Core Four.

912
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:46,304
Guys. What the hell?

913
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:49,611
<i>We're hearing from sources
inside the homicide division</i>

914
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:53,659
<i>that the prime suspect is none
other than Samantha Carpenter,</i>

915
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:57,228

the Woodsboro killings in 2022,</i>

916
00:50:57,402 --> 00:51:00,753

on the street last night.</i>

917
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,755
<i>is wrong with you?</i>

918
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:05,105
<i>You got a problem with me?
Knock it off!</i>

919
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:07,281
<i>Stay away from her.
She knows what she did.</i>

920
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:09,544
<i>In the wake
of the Woodsboro tragedy
last year,</i>

921
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:11,372
<i>rumors sprouted online</i>

922
00:51:11,546 --> 00:51:14,984
<i>that Carpenter was actually

00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:17,813
<i>blaming the crimes

924
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:19,815
<i>and teen Amber Free--</i>

925
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:45,276
I know you're not a fan
of the way
that I've been handling things,

926
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,582
and that I've been giving you
a really hard time.

927
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:48,931
But I can say

928
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:52,935
that none of us can relate
to what you are experiencing.

929
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:59,333
And I'm really, really sorry
that you have to do that alone.

930
00:52:03,903 --> 00:52:05,078
It's not your fault.

931
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,691
And I know I shouldn't care
what people think.

932
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:14,696
It just sucks
being this hated.

933
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:20,224
Hey. Hey. Just a reminder,

934
00:52:20,398 --> 00:52:23,488
not a single person
in this room hates you.

935
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:27,535
Okay?
We have all been through
some fucked-up stuff,

936
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:30,277
and we are
coping with it differently.

937
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:32,323
But, I mean,
we moved here together

938
00:52:32,497 --> 00:52:34,368
for one
very specific reason.

939
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:38,285
We are a team.

940
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,464
We are

941
00:52:43,638 --> 00:52:45,249
the Core Fucking Four.

942
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:47,251
- Thank you very much.
- Ah, I hate myself.

943
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:49,557
You said it.
That is what I'm talking about.

944
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:51,211
It's the Core Four.

945
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:53,300
Say it.[Tara] I'm not gonna say it.

946
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:54,954
I mean, yes,
we're a team, but...

947
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:56,738
It's got a nice ring to it.

948
00:52:56,912 --> 00:52:59,872
I've been sleeping with Cute Boy
from across the hall.

949
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:05,138
- Boom!
- I fucking knew it!

950
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:07,967
- I knew it, I knew it.
- You called it.

951
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:10,056
I knew it from the day
you had that hickey.

952
00:53:11,927 --> 00:53:14,191
<i>Sales
of the Ghostface Halloween mask</i>

953
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:19,021
<i>across the Tri-State area
in the last 24 hours
have gone through the roof!</i>

954
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,588
<i>I've got my mask.</i>

955
00:53:20,762 --> 00:53:22,024
<i>What about you, Jay?</i>[Jay] <i>You know it.</i>

956
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,592
<i>It's gonna be
one spooky Halloween.</i>

957
00:53:24,766 --> 00:53:26,594
<i>I'll say. Now, let's get over to Guy
for a look at our weather.</i>

958
00:53:28,161 --> 00:53:31,599
I know she's my roommate,
but you're, like, the police.

959
00:53:33,035 --> 00:53:34,385
Yo.

960
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:37,257
[Quinn] No, I know.

961
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:38,650
Hey!

962
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:40,869
Fuck.

963
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:42,828
Hey, yeah.
Wassup, bitch?

964
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:45,091
I see you, motherfucker.

965
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,442
Sam! Samantha!

966
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:50,705
I feel like we should high five
or something.

967
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:52,577
The Core Four High Five--
may we, please?

968
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:54,840
Don't call it that,
but we'll do the high five.

969
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:56,450
Come on.

970
00:53:56,624 --> 00:53:59,279
Sam! Samantha!

971
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:01,150
Sam, what the fuck?

972
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:03,762
She's really
freaked out and paranoid.

973
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:06,155
Babe, you gonna join me?[Quinn] Hang on.

974
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,332
No. And don't use
my good face wash.

975
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:10,464
It's pH-balanced for women.

976
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:12,858
Pick up your phone, baby.

977
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,559
Is that him?

978
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:21,910
- No, Tara. Not right now.
- Hey, what are your intentions?

979
00:54:22,084 --> 00:54:23,869
[Chad] That's right.

980
00:54:24,043 --> 00:54:26,350
It's fine. I'll call him back.

981
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:28,003
Poor guy.[Chad] Okay.

982
00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:33,270
Quinn and her gentleman caller
are back at it again.

983
00:54:33,444 --> 00:54:35,315
She's getting it,
too? Okay.

984
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:53,855
Help! Stop!

985
00:54:55,553 --> 00:54:56,815
Tara, wait, wait!

986
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:07,434
Run.

987
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:10,394
Oh, shit!

988
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:14,267
Guys, come on!

989
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:17,096
Oh, fuck.

990
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:19,533
[Anika] Mindy!

991
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:21,274
Stay the fuck back!

992
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:46,212
Hey!

993
00:55:50,782 --> 00:55:52,131
Wait, wait, Chad!

994
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:53,785
- They're still up there.
- Shit!

995
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:02,446
Fuck.

996
00:56:04,709 --> 00:56:06,928
- Sam!
- Do you have the keys?

997
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:08,539
No, I left them inside!

998
00:56:17,243 --> 00:56:19,419
Mindy, bathroom door. Hurry!

999
00:56:21,987 --> 00:56:23,771
Oh, fuck! That guy's dead.

1000
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:46,054
Oh, shit.

1001
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:48,361
Oh, fuck.

1002
00:56:50,015 --> 00:56:50,972
Hey!

1003
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:55,716
Hey!

1004
00:56:57,805 --> 00:56:58,893
Shit.

1005
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:03,985
Don't worry,
I got you.

1006
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,946
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- You have a better idea?

1007
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,035
Fuck. No.

1008
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:19,000
You have to come
one at a time.

1009
00:57:19,174 --> 00:57:21,394
- You two go first. Mindy!
- What? No.

1010
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:22,917
Someone needs
to hold the door.

1011
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:25,398
I'll send Anika next. Go!

1012
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,793
Sam, come on.
Eyes on me, baby.

1013
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:30,359
Keep your eyes on me.

1014
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:32,797
Oh, shit.

1015
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,496
Oh, my God.[Danny] I got you, baby.

1016
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,761
Baby, come on!

1017
00:57:41,762 --> 00:57:43,372
It won't hold me.

1018
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:45,113
Okay.

1019
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:47,333
It ain't going anywhere.
It's gonna hold you, I promise.

1020
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:48,508
Danny.

1021
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:54,601
I got you.
You ain't going nowhere.
Let's go.

1022
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:58,692
- She's losing a lot of blood!
- Say something more positive!

1023
00:57:58,866 --> 00:58:01,216
Eyes on me, Sam.
Come on, baby.

1024
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,611
[Danny] Come on. I got you.

1025
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:06,265
Come on, I got you.

1026
00:58:10,443 --> 00:58:11,270
Okay.

1027
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:12,793
- Come on!
- Let's go!

1028
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:15,187
- Come on, Mindy!
- Let's go, we got to move!

1029
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:16,797
Anika, come on!

1030
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:20,975
Anika![Danny] Go! Come on!

1031
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:23,195
You have to go first.[Anika whimpering] I can't.

1032
00:58:24,152 --> 00:58:25,502
You have to go.

1033
00:58:25,676 --> 00:58:28,287
Mindy, no! I'll be
right behind you, I promise.

1034
00:58:32,726 --> 00:58:34,728
Mindy, come on.
You got to get over here!

1035
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:36,077
Let's go!

1036
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:39,690
We got you.[Sam] That's it. Mindy.

1037
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:41,822
Slow and steady.[Sam] We got you.

1038
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:44,912
Oh, God.

1039
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:48,829
Baby, you can't stop.[Sam] Get over here right now!

1040
00:58:49,003 --> 00:58:51,484
Anika's coming right behind you.

1041
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:58,404
Anika, come on![Danny] Go!

1042
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,798
You can do it![Mindy] Come on, Anika!

1043
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:04,236
Oh, God!
I can't do it, I can't do it.

1044
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,805
Don't look down![Mindy] Look at me!

1045
00:59:07,979 --> 00:59:11,025
You can do it!
You're doing good.

1046
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,816
What?

1047
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:20,600
Anika, you have to move
right now!

1048
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:24,386
No, God! Please, no!

1049
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,692
Anika, you got to move!

1050
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:29,174
No!

1051
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:37,574
You have to make it!

1052
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:39,314
Baby, I don't want to die!

1053
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:41,142
No, Anika.

1054
00:59:45,146 --> 00:59:47,453
Anika, give me your hand.
I got you.

1055
00:59:57,768 --> 00:59:59,857
No!

1056
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:26,057
So are you
pullin' anybody for interviews?

1057
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:27,841
How far along are you on that?

1058
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:29,321
Uh, just got two.

1059
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:32,541
Okay.

1060
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:36,415
Hey. You okay?

1061
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:42,464
This isn't your fault, Sam.

1062
01:00:43,814 --> 01:00:44,815
But it is.

1063
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:51,691
Someone took our knives,

1064
01:00:52,474 --> 01:00:54,128
so we couldn't fight back.

1065
01:00:54,912 --> 01:00:56,653
I don't know
who I can trust.

1066
01:00:59,046 --> 01:01:02,354
Then don't trust anyone.
Not your friends. Not me.

1067
01:01:03,485 --> 01:01:04,965
Not anyone.

1068
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:07,272
I have
a few more questions for you.

1069
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:10,405
Just this way, Danny.

1070
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:18,718
Chad.

1071
01:01:21,895 --> 01:01:23,462
- Where were you?
- What? When?

1072
01:01:23,636 --> 01:01:24,550
- Last night!
- What?

1073
01:01:24,724 --> 01:01:25,943
I had Econ.
You know this.

1074
01:01:26,117 --> 01:01:27,161
Bullshit, man!
You disappear,

1075
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:28,859
and my sister
almost gets killed!

1076
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:30,904
Dude, I was in a study hall
with a hundred other people.

1077
01:01:31,078 --> 01:01:32,689
You can ask any of them.

1078
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,691
Fuck, man.

1079
01:01:36,475 --> 01:01:37,563
Oh, my God.

1080
01:01:38,607 --> 01:01:40,827
Who?[Chad] Anika and Quinn.

1081
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:44,875
Mindy, I'm so sorry.

1082
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:46,572
Step the fuck back.

1083
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,880
You're at the top of my list.

1084
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:51,882
I had Econ!

1085
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,154
Go right ahead, sir.

1086
01:02:08,202 --> 01:02:09,943
I'm gonna be right back.

1087
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:18,691
I'm really sorry
about Quinn.

1088
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:21,694
Thank you.

1089
01:02:24,436 --> 01:02:26,090
Both my kids are gone.

1090
01:02:27,134 --> 01:02:29,049
My whole family...

1091
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:30,529
...is gone.

1092
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:36,709
They took me
off the case.

1093
01:02:36,883 --> 01:02:39,190
But I'm not gonna stop
until I find him.

1094
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:41,627
You fuck with my family...

1095
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:44,064
you die.

1096
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:46,719
Agreed.

1097
01:02:46,893 --> 01:02:49,635
Hey, are you okay?
I came as soon as I heard.

1098
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:51,115
Gale, I swear to God...

1099
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:54,074
Truce, okay?
I'm here for whatever you need.

1100
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:55,336
Okay. Nice try.

1101
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,990
Really, I am.

1102
01:02:58,252 --> 01:03:00,037
Okay, fine.
Off the record, okay?

1103
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,738
Okay. Thank you.

1104
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,962
I'm sorry I punched you.

1105
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:13,920
No, you're not.

1106
01:03:14,094 --> 01:03:15,182
I'm not.

1107
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:19,273
You're the cop, right?

1108
01:03:19,447 --> 01:03:21,319
I did some digging
on your first two victims

1109
01:03:21,493 --> 01:03:22,624
and I found something.

1110
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,018
I know where the masks
are coming from.

1111
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:26,454
Show me.

1112
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:27,542
Ladies.

1113
01:03:28,587 --> 01:03:29,806
Kirby?

1114
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:31,677
Gale.

1115
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:33,897
She's with the FBI.She's a child.

1116
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:36,116
When did they start
letting children into the FBI?

1117
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:39,119
- I'm 30.
- Well, you look like a zygote.

1118
01:03:39,293 --> 01:03:40,599
I have a gun, Gale.

1119
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:43,297
Okay, fine. You're gonna
want to see this, too.

1120
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:48,650
Jason and Greg
were little Atlanta rich boys.

1121
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,392
Apparently, they used
fake names to rent this place.

1122
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:53,090
How did you find it?

1123
01:03:53,264 --> 01:03:56,006
It's called
"investigative journalism"
for a reason.

1124
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:59,836
How didn't you find it?
Weren't you tracking them?

1125
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,708
I went through
their financial records
dozens of times.

1126
01:04:02,882 --> 01:04:05,580
This was not in any of them.
Doesn't make sense.

1127
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:07,234
Don't worry.

1128
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:09,323
I'm just really good at my job.
You'll get there.

1129
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:25,949
What is this place?
What's with all the security?

1130
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:30,910
It's a movie theater.

1131
01:04:31,084 --> 01:04:32,607
It's not just a theater.

1132
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:34,827
It's a shrine.

1133
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,845
Whoa.

1134
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:11,211
They've got
the whole goddamn franchise.

1135
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:27,793
- Chad?
- Mmm?

1136
01:05:28,446 --> 01:05:29,838
This was Uncle Randy's.

1137
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:32,406
They've got everything.

1138
01:05:35,757 --> 01:05:37,716
Is that--The knife I was stabbed with.

1139
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,023
You all have been through
so much.

1140
01:05:41,502 --> 01:05:43,635
Who drew all these?

1141
01:05:57,605 --> 01:05:58,737
Dewey.

1142
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:00,957
Hey, how'd they get
all this stuff?

1143
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:03,524
Isn't this evidence?

1144
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:05,439
Well, cops like money,

1145
01:06:05,613 --> 01:06:08,834
and evidence can get lost
pretty easily.

1146
01:06:10,618 --> 01:06:12,794
Present company excluded,
of course.

1147
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:18,365
Um, why am I here exactly?
My alibi checks out.

1148
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:21,151
So I can keep an eye on you, roomie.

1149
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:23,544
The killer must have
found this place

1150
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:25,459
before he murdered Jason
and Greg.

1151
01:06:25,633 --> 01:06:28,593
And then he took the masks
off the mannequins.

1152
01:06:28,767 --> 01:06:31,900
All nine, from Stu and Billy
to Amber and Richie.

1153
01:06:57,622 --> 01:07:00,712
Hot damn!
How fucking cool is this place?

1154
01:07:00,886 --> 01:07:02,105
Fuck, no.

1155
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:03,367
Fuck, yes.

1156
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:05,325
Come on, Sam,
you got to be excited

1157
01:07:05,499 --> 01:07:08,111
to get our murder on again. Together.

1158
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:11,244
Billy and Sam.
Team Loomis.

1159
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:14,682
Get ready to slice up
more motherfuckers.

1160
01:07:25,258 --> 01:07:26,781
What are you doing?

1161
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:32,657
I don't know.

1162
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,793
So,

1163
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:41,187
somebody killed
these chucklefucks

1164
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,537
and took over?

1165
01:07:43,711 --> 01:07:46,584
Someone who believes that Sam
masterminded Woodsboro.

1166
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:48,194
If this were
a normal <i>Stab</i> movie,

1167
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:50,066
this would be the killer's lair.

1168
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,764
Which means this isn't
a normal <i>Stab</i> movie.

1169
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:11,435
The TV that killed Stu Macher.

1170
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,263
If you believe he's dead.

1171
01:08:15,352 --> 01:08:17,223
I hear
you're a horror fan.

1172
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:19,486
- It's been said.
- Mmm.

1173
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:20,792
Mmm.

1174
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:22,750
Best <i>Nightmare
on Elm Street?</i>

1175
01:08:22,924 --> 01:08:24,361
The original.

1176
01:08:24,535 --> 01:08:26,232
Best <i>Friday the 13th?</i>

1177
01:08:26,406 --> 01:08:27,668
Part II.The Final Chapter.

1178
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:30,671
Had a crush
on Corey Feldman.

1179
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:32,456
Okay. Respect.

1180
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:34,762
<i>Psycho II</i> is...

1181
01:08:34,936 --> 01:08:36,024
...underrated.

1182
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:40,072
<i>Candyman.</i>
The original or requel?

1183
01:08:40,246 --> 01:08:41,160
Both.

1184
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:44,729
Okay. Okay.

1185
01:08:44,903 --> 01:08:46,513
Game recognize game.

1186
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:49,168
Hmm.

1187
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:55,131
You okay?

1188
01:08:58,003 --> 01:09:00,266
Sam, when do I get
to be a normal person again?

1189
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:04,444
I don't know.

1190
01:09:04,618 --> 01:09:06,533
I don't want
to be a part of this.

1191
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,667
I don't want to be a part
of some stupid legacy

1192
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:11,408
because I'm--Because of me.

1193
01:09:14,106 --> 01:09:16,195
I'm sorry.

1194
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:17,588
Just drop it, Sam.

1195
01:09:19,459 --> 01:09:20,460
Tara.

1196
01:09:21,374 --> 01:09:22,332
I got her.

1197
01:09:27,337 --> 01:09:28,729
That seemed intense.

1198
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,777
Ever since I came back
into her life, I've just...

1199
01:09:35,693 --> 01:09:37,129
made a mess of it.

1200
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:38,696
Hey.

1201
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:40,611
Where's your mother
in all this?

1202
01:09:40,785 --> 01:09:44,136
She cut me off
when I told Tara
about Billy.

1203
01:09:45,006 --> 01:09:46,094
Then Tara cut her off

1204
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:48,706
because she wouldn't
talk to me,

1205
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,317
so now neither of us
have a mother.

1206
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:53,885
I'm sorry to say this,
but fuck her.

1207
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:56,192
My parents sucked, too.

1208
01:09:58,019 --> 01:10:00,239
But you can still
make your own family.

1209
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:02,720
Even if it's just
with one person.

1210
01:10:06,898 --> 01:10:09,292
And if you lose
that one person?

1211
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:12,860
You just-- You keep going.

1212
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,515
And maybe
you find another loner,

1213
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:17,561
and you look after each other.

1214
01:10:26,004 --> 01:10:28,049
How'd you get past
what happened to you?

1215
01:10:33,446 --> 01:10:35,361
I almost died
after I was stabbed.

1216
01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:38,625
Technically, I did die.

1217
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:40,279
For four minutes.

1218
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:44,588
When I recovered...

1219
01:10:45,806 --> 01:10:47,678
I got mad.

1220
01:10:47,852 --> 01:10:51,508
I didn't want
to spend the rest of my life
being afraid of monsters.

1221
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:55,773
I wanted the monsters
to be afraid of me.

1222
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:58,341
I like that.

1223
01:10:58,515 --> 01:11:00,647
[Bailey] Sorry to interrupt.

1224
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:02,780
Think I might have an idea

1225
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:04,216
about how to turn the tables
on this creep.

1226
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:06,218
Yeah. We're in.

1227
01:11:06,392 --> 01:11:08,481
Sorry, Gale.
No press allowed.

1228
01:11:08,655 --> 01:11:10,875
Police business.
I'm good at my job, too.

1229
01:11:17,795 --> 01:11:19,405
You should have stayed
with the others.

1230
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:21,189
That's not gonna happen.

1231
01:11:21,364 --> 01:11:24,410
There's no point in both of us
putting ourselves at risk.

1232
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:27,283
I'm not.
I'm your backup.

1233
01:11:31,722 --> 01:11:33,680
So we're really doing
the phone tracing thing

1234
01:11:33,854 --> 01:11:35,552
that never works
in the movies.

1235
01:11:35,726 --> 01:11:37,554
It'll be all, "Keep him talking,
Sam. Two more minutes,

1236
01:11:37,728 --> 01:11:39,251
I've almost got him."

1237
01:11:39,425 --> 01:11:41,427
And then he hangs up just
before we can get a lock.

1238
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:45,083
I can trace a call
in under 15 seconds.

1239
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:50,393
Well, you've got them
out there as bait.

1240
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:52,395
Because the killer usually calls
from somewhere nearby.

1241
01:11:52,569 --> 01:11:54,701
And you think they're safe
because it's broad daylight

1242
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:56,050
in a public place?

1243
01:11:56,224 --> 01:11:58,357
Look, I am here, okay?
And so is Bailey.

1244
01:11:58,531 --> 01:12:01,055
This is exactly
how our Uncle Randy died.

1245
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:02,840
Broad daylight.
Public place.

1246
01:12:03,014 --> 01:12:05,930
Yanked into a van.
Stab, stab, stab. No more Randy.

1247
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:08,106
Huh.

1248
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:14,852
Hey, Sam?
Stay frosty out there, okay?

1249
01:12:15,026 --> 01:12:16,027
We're good.

1250
01:12:39,877 --> 01:12:41,226
You're gonna die,
you know.

1251
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,184
<i>No, you're gonna die, Samantha!</i>

1252
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,884
<i>Choking on your own blood
while I hack up your sister.</i>

1253
01:12:47,798 --> 01:12:49,495
Unless we find you first.

1254
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:52,759
<i>For a mastermind,
you're not very bright.</i>

1255
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:54,457
<i>Waiting for me to call,</i>

1256
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:57,373
<i>desperately hoping I'm nearby
so the police can grab me?</i>

1257
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:03,291
<i>But I'm not nearby.
I'm a step ahead.</i>

1258
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:06,251
<i>Be seeing you, Samantha.</i>

1259
01:13:08,209 --> 01:13:12,083
- Did you get it?
- Yep. Geolocation
coming through right now.

1260
01:13:14,346 --> 01:13:15,739
He's on the Upper West Side.

1261
01:13:15,913 --> 01:13:17,828
<i>He's inside
an apartment building,</i>

1262
01:13:18,002 --> 01:13:19,177
<i>halfway across the city.</i>

1263
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:21,745
- On West 96th?
- How did you know that?

1264
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:26,750
Gale.

1265
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:29,666
"No press."

1266
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,104
Bitch, last time I saw you,
you were in glee club.

1267
01:13:33,278 --> 01:13:35,933
Forgive me if I don't trust you
to keep them safe.

1268
01:13:36,107 --> 01:13:38,414
- Here you go, baby.
- Thanks.

1269
01:13:38,588 --> 01:13:40,198
My friend Danny works
on the Upper West Side.

1270
01:13:40,372 --> 01:13:41,417
He can get there quicker.

1271
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:42,505
Yeah,
or he could finish her off.

1272
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:44,376
Is it possible he's the killer?

1273
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,030
Fuck.
We have to get there now.

1274
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:47,814
It's 50 blocks away.
We don't even know if it's true.

1275
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:50,077
- Sam, wait! Take a minute.
- We don't have a minute.

1276
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:51,949
You have to trust me,
we got to make the right call.

1277
01:13:52,123 --> 01:13:53,559
He's already--[Tara] Sam!

1278
01:13:53,733 --> 01:13:54,734
Get in.

1279
01:13:54,908 --> 01:13:56,649
What's she doing?

1280
01:13:56,823 --> 01:13:58,564
Hey, get out of my car!

1281
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:01,437
What do you think you're doing?
That's an official vehicle! Hey!

1282
01:14:01,611 --> 01:14:02,742
Should we use the sirens?

1283
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:04,048
Did you think
we'd steal a police car

1284
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:05,266
and not use the sirens?

1285
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,790
- Do you have a license?
- Fuck, yeah.

1286
01:14:06,964 --> 01:14:08,748
What are you doing?

1287
01:14:08,922 --> 01:14:11,577
It's a cop car!
You can't steal a cop car!

1288
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:16,408
That'll be our food.

1289
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:19,759
Hello?

1290
01:14:20,934 --> 01:14:22,458
Not the food. It's for you.

1291
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:24,460
Who is it?

1292
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:26,157
May I ask who's calling, please?

1293
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,508
He says it's the killer.

1294
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:39,431
Hello?[Ghostface] <i>Hello, Gale.</i>

1295
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:42,652
<i>Strange that you and I
have never spoken on the phone.</i>

1296
01:14:42,826 --> 01:14:44,828
<i>This is long overdue.</i>

1297
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:46,394
I agree.

1298
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:48,005
Call the police.

1299
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:50,834
<i>I figured
after all these years</i>

1300
01:14:51,008 --> 01:14:53,401
<i>you'd want an interview.</i>

1301
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:55,795
Well, you figured right.

1302
01:14:57,536 --> 01:15:00,452
So, what's your motive
this time?

1303
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:03,629
You angry at the movies or you
just trying to stay relevant?

1304
01:15:03,803 --> 01:15:05,805
<i>I could ask you the same.</i>

1305
01:15:05,979 --> 01:15:09,417
<i>Don't you know
the legacy characters
are disposable now?</i>

1306
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:12,072
<i>Nobody cares
about last century's heroes.</i>

1307
01:15:12,246 --> 01:15:15,467
Then why bother with me at all?
<i>Call it nostalgia.</i>

1308
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:17,425
<i>Or maybe
you deserve to be punished</i>

1309
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,167
<i>for all that money you made
off the misery of others.</i>

1310
01:15:20,341 --> 01:15:25,303
<i>Maybe it's time
someone made a buck
reporting your death.</i>

1311
01:15:25,477 --> 01:15:27,958
You know you're like the tenth
guy to try this, right?

1312
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:30,395
And spoiler alert,

1313
01:15:30,569 --> 01:15:33,703
it never works out
for the dipshit in the mask.

1314
01:15:35,661 --> 01:15:38,925
<i>Oh, but they certainly
leave a mark
before they go, don't they?</i>

1315
01:15:39,099 --> 01:15:42,146
<i>Richie and Amber
managed to butcher Dewey.</i>

1316
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,149
<i>Carved him up
like a Christmas goose.</i>

1317
01:15:45,323 --> 01:15:49,327
<i>How does it feel
to lose the only man
who ever loved you?</i>

1318
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:50,720
Fuck you!

1319
01:15:50,894 --> 01:15:52,156
<i>How does it feel to know</i>

1320
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,767
<i>that you weren't
there for him at the end?</i>

1321
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:58,466
<i>Not there to give him comfort</i>

1322
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:00,904
<i>as he died screaming
in his own guts.</i>

1323
01:16:01,078 --> 01:16:03,297
You're the one
who's gonna die screaming.

1324
01:16:03,471 --> 01:16:06,866
<i>Maybe. But you won't
be around to see it.</i>

1325
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,173
<i>You couldn't stop
what happened to Dewey.</i>

1326
01:16:09,347 --> 01:16:11,392
<i>Just like you're not
gonna be able to stop this.</i>

1327
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,561
Oh, God!

1328
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:16,675
How's that for nostalgia, fucker?

1329
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:31,081
<i>You missed.</i>

1330
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:32,256
Sure I did.

1331
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:33,866
<i>You win.</i>

1332
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,651
<i>I'm in the elevator
heading for the ground floor.</i>

1333
01:17:36,608 --> 01:17:37,870
Sure you are.

1334
01:17:41,744 --> 01:17:43,006
<i>Maybe you did hit me.</i>

1335
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:44,660
<i>Maybe I'm wounded.</i>

1336
01:17:44,834 --> 01:17:47,750
<i>Or maybe I'm wearing
a bulletproof vest.</i>

1337
01:17:47,924 --> 01:17:50,840
That's why I'm gonna shoot you
in the fucking head!

1338
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,464
<i>You would've made
a good killer, Gale.</i>

1339
01:18:06,638 --> 01:18:09,554
<i>Sidney never would've
made sense, and Dewey
was the fan favorite.</i>

1340
01:18:09,728 --> 01:18:11,948
<i>But you
cracking under the pressure</i>

1341
01:18:12,122 --> 01:18:15,603
<i>and turning into Ghostface
would've been a great twist.</i>

1342
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:17,257
Keep talking, asshole.

1343
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:21,871
<i>Sure.
What do you want to talk about?</i>

1344
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:27,398
<i>You never got to be
the leading lady, did you?</i>

1345
01:18:27,572 --> 01:18:30,706
<i>It was always all about
poor sweet Sidney,</i>

1346
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,620
<i>sucking up all the oxygen.</i>

1347
01:18:32,795 --> 01:18:34,622
<i>What did that leave you
to be?</i>

1348
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:36,537
The brains
and the sex appeal.

1349
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:39,758
<i>Sorry about your boyfriend.</i>

1350
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:43,022
<i>All those muscles
didn't help much.</i>

1351
01:18:43,196 --> 01:18:44,197
They sure didn't.

1352
01:18:47,418 --> 01:18:48,462
Can you hold, please?

1353
01:18:48,636 --> 01:18:50,943
<i>Huh?</i>

1354
01:20:13,069 --> 01:20:14,461
Fuck you!

1355
01:20:14,635 --> 01:20:16,463
Hey, fuckface!

1356
01:20:21,642 --> 01:20:23,209
Gale!

1357
01:20:24,123 --> 01:20:25,777
Oh, shit. Gale?

1358
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,301
Gale.

1359
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:31,261
Sorry.

1360
01:20:31,435 --> 01:20:32,784
I'm sorry.

1361
01:20:34,264 --> 01:20:36,005
I should've known that he was
gonna come after you.

1362
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:38,224
I'm so sorry.

1363
01:20:39,225 --> 01:20:40,661
He didn't get me.

1364
01:20:43,273 --> 01:20:44,317
Tell Sidney

1365
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:46,885
he never got me.

1366
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:53,674
Gale?

1367
01:20:56,329 --> 01:20:57,591
- Gale.
- Gale.

1368
01:20:57,765 --> 01:20:59,071
Gale? Please.

1369
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:00,594
Out of the way!

1370
01:21:00,768 --> 01:21:03,902
- Out of the way!
- Move. You got to move. Move!

1371
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:05,512
No! No!

1372
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:07,601
Okay. Get them back,
please.[Tara] Sam, please!

1373
01:21:07,775 --> 01:21:10,474
- They need to move now.
- Excuse me. Please step back.

1374
01:21:10,648 --> 01:21:13,216
Call it in.[paramedic 2] Right away.

1375
01:21:14,739 --> 01:21:17,133
Checking.[Tara] Come on, Gale.

1376
01:21:20,266 --> 01:21:22,355
Got a weak pulse.
Get the backboard.

1377
01:21:22,529 --> 01:21:24,444
We need to move now.[paramedic 2] Yeah.

1378
01:21:27,404 --> 01:21:29,536
Backboard! Let's move.

1379
01:21:42,332 --> 01:21:44,769
Hey. Hey.

1380
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,466
I got here as fast as I could.

1381
01:21:48,599 --> 01:21:49,861
Did you?

1382
01:21:51,471 --> 01:21:53,125
I'm scared,
you guys.

1383
01:21:53,299 --> 01:21:55,258
I really don't want
to get hurt again.

1384
01:21:56,302 --> 01:21:57,303
Neither do I.

1385
01:21:59,001 --> 01:22:00,524
I don't want you
getting hurt again, either.

1386
01:22:00,698 --> 01:22:02,569
I know. I know.

1387
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:09,968
So what do we do now?

1388
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,885
Maybe he gets to win this time.

1389
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,238
He wants to punish me.

1390
01:22:22,024 --> 01:22:23,025
Me.

1391
01:22:25,027 --> 01:22:27,116
So maybe I let him.

1392
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:29,596
I'll just give myself up.

1393
01:22:30,902 --> 01:22:32,730
If this is what I have to do

1394
01:22:33,861 --> 01:22:35,341
to keep you safe,

1395
01:22:36,647 --> 01:22:37,735
it's worth it.

1396
01:22:37,909 --> 01:22:39,737
No, we're not doing that, Sam.

1397
01:22:39,911 --> 01:22:42,218
You went back to Woodsboro
to protect me.

1398
01:22:42,392 --> 01:22:44,698
Every single day, you make
the decision to protect me.

1399
01:22:44,872 --> 01:22:47,571
None of us would even be alive
if it weren't for you.

1400
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:49,965
You have to let us
protect you this time.

1401
01:22:51,227 --> 01:22:52,445
- No.
- Yes.

1402
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:55,796
We're a team, remember?

1403
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,276
Actually,

1404
01:22:58,321 --> 01:22:59,322
we're a family.

1405
01:22:59,496 --> 01:23:02,194
Let's go! Core Four!
Come on.

1406
01:23:02,368 --> 01:23:03,761
- Core Four.
- Come on.

1407
01:23:03,935 --> 01:23:05,502
- Core what?
- It's an us thing.

1408
01:23:07,504 --> 01:23:09,332
He's gonna keep
coming after us.

1409
01:23:09,506 --> 01:23:12,813
Isn't there somewhere safe
we could just hole up in?

1410
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,641
No, he's gonna keep finding us.

1411
01:23:14,815 --> 01:23:15,947
Great.

1412
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:19,995
We could use that, though.

1413
01:23:23,085 --> 01:23:27,002
I'm getting my ass chewed out
for not dropping the case
and now you want me to do what?

1414
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:29,743
We want to lure him
to a secure location
and trap him inside.

1415
01:23:31,049 --> 01:23:32,050
And then what?

1416
01:23:33,704 --> 01:23:34,748
We execute him.

1417
01:23:40,363 --> 01:23:41,842
Are you gonna help us?

1418
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:45,933
Let's kill
the son of a bitch.

1419
01:23:46,108 --> 01:23:47,805
<i>Now, I'm stuck here,</i>

1420
01:23:47,979 --> 01:23:49,502
<i>but Gale gave us
the keycards to the theater.</i>

1421
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:51,722
It's got heavy surveillance
and security cameras,

1422
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:54,072
but we can use that against him.

1423
01:23:54,246 --> 01:23:55,465
<i>I'll tell Kirby
to meet you there.</i>

1424
01:23:55,639 --> 01:23:57,162
<i>I'll join you
as soon as I can.</i>

1425
01:23:57,336 --> 01:23:59,686
- Got it.
- And remember, travel in public.

1426
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:01,775
The more people around you,
the less chance he has

1427
01:24:01,949 --> 01:24:04,169
<i>to take a shot at you
before you get there.</i>

1428
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,742
Is this even a good plan?

1429
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:14,049
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

1430
01:24:14,223 --> 01:24:16,703
So we just peel off
and the killer picks us off
one by one? No, thank you.

1431
01:24:16,877 --> 01:24:19,141
Let's just get to the theater.
Come on, in here.

1432
01:24:19,315 --> 01:24:20,881
Yes, because it'll be
much less scary

1433
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,101
at the serial killer
movie theater.

1434
01:24:23,275 --> 01:24:24,276
Fuck.

1435
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:27,192
Wait, hey, hey! Chad!

1436
01:24:27,366 --> 01:24:29,020
Hey! Fuck! Chad!

1437
01:24:30,152 --> 01:24:31,196
Tara!

1438
01:24:32,763 --> 01:24:34,939
- Wait, where's Mindy?
- Chad! Sam! Hey, Sam!

1439
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:37,028
Mindy! Mindy! Mindy!

1440
01:24:38,595 --> 01:24:40,075
Let's go. Shit.

1441
01:24:40,249 --> 01:24:41,337
Fuck!

1442
01:24:46,516 --> 01:24:47,517
Fuck.

1443
01:24:56,178 --> 01:24:58,615
Get your Ghostface ass
away from me, Ghostface.

1444
01:25:02,706 --> 01:25:04,751
<i>The next local one train</i>

1445

1446
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,015

<i>...five minutes.</i>

1448
01:25:15,327 --> 01:25:17,242
- Where's Mindy?
- She missed the train.

1449
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:19,636
I was gonna wait for her,
but Cute Boy here dragged me on.

1450
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:21,638
- Trying to keep us together.
- By pulling us apart?

1451
01:25:24,467 --> 01:25:25,424
It's okay.

1452
01:25:25,598 --> 01:25:27,165
It's fine. She's with Ethan.

1453
01:25:27,339 --> 01:25:29,559
She'll meet us there.

1454

Hey.

1501
01:31:28,874 --> 01:31:32,269
I talked to Bailey.
I've got everything set up.

- Where are Mindy and Ethan?
- They're five minutes
behind us.

1503

Let's get you
all inside.

1504
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:40,364
- Not you.
- What?

1505
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:43,976
Don't trust anyone, remember?

1506
01:31:45,412 --> 01:31:46,544
We don't know you.

1507
01:31:48,154 --> 01:31:49,199
Not really.

1508
01:31:50,287 --> 01:31:51,244
You know me.

1509
01:31:51,418 --> 01:31:53,246
You're not Woodsboro.

1510
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:56,815
I'm sorry.

1511
01:31:57,903 --> 01:32:00,732

It's okay, I get it.

1512
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:03,866
Be safe, okay?

1513
01:32:05,302 --> 01:32:06,433
Okay?

1514
01:32:07,434 --> 01:32:08,479
You, too.

1515
01:32:11,787 --> 01:32:12,701
Good call.

1516
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:19,577
I cleared the whole place
before you got here.

1517
01:32:21,274 --> 01:32:23,886
So, this is the only way
in or out.

1518
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,670
He steps in
through the first door,

1519
01:32:25,844 --> 01:32:28,543
both doors lock automatically,
trapping him inside.

1520
01:32:28,717 --> 01:32:30,675
We turn it into a kill box.

1521
01:32:30,849 --> 01:32:34,505
- Weapons?
- One gun,
and I hold onto it.

1522
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:36,159
I am the only one
with a badge here

1523
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:37,726
and that's the way
it's gonna be.

1524
01:32:39,292 --> 01:32:40,642
We're safe here.

1525
01:32:43,906 --> 01:32:47,126
I'm gonna check in with Mindy.
See if they're close.

1526
01:33:08,539 --> 01:33:09,975
Come on, come on.

1527
01:33:10,149 --> 01:33:12,978
<i>Hey, you've reached me.
Leave a message.</i>

1528
01:33:13,152 --> 01:33:14,763
You know you're not safe here.

1529
01:33:14,937 --> 01:33:16,591
Whenever someone says,
"We're safe here,"

1530
01:33:16,765 --> 01:33:18,288
it means you're not.[Sam] Not now.

1531
01:33:18,462 --> 01:33:20,507
But you're smarter than this, Sam.

1532
01:33:20,682 --> 01:33:22,858
Grab a weapon
and clear this place yourself.

1533
01:33:25,382 --> 01:33:26,688
You know I'm right.

1534
01:33:42,965 --> 01:33:44,444
Excellent choice.

1535
01:33:46,795 --> 01:33:48,057

Kirby?

1537
01:33:57,022 --> 01:33:58,023
Kirby!

1538
01:34:18,827 --> 01:34:20,524
Hello?

1539
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:22,569
Get everyone out of there, Sam.
You're not safe.

1540
01:34:22,744 --> 01:34:24,441
<i>I heard
from the Atlanta field office.</i>

1541
01:34:24,615 --> 01:34:26,835

- What are you talking about?</i>

1543
01:34:29,881 --> 01:34:32,754

for being mentally unstable.

1544
01:34:32,928 --> 01:34:35,408
<i>What?</i> She's no longer with the FBI.

1545
01:34:49,248 --> 01:34:50,597
<i>Listen, asshole.</i>

1546
01:34:50,772 --> 01:34:52,164
<i>No, you listen,
you little bitch.</i>

1547
01:34:52,338 --> 01:34:54,558
<i>Hang up on me, I'll gut you
like a fish. Understand?</i>

1548
01:34:54,732 --> 01:34:55,994
<i>What do you want?</i>

1549
01:34:56,168 --> 01:34:58,693
<i>To see
what your insides look like.</i>

1550
01:35:02,914 --> 01:35:04,524
Oh, shit.

1551
01:35:12,663 --> 01:35:14,883
When was the last time
anybody used this place?

1552
01:35:15,057 --> 01:35:16,711
It's so old.

1553
01:35:20,758 --> 01:35:23,892
Um. I'm sorry,
you can have them.

1554
01:35:24,066 --> 01:35:25,676
- Take them.
- No, I mean...

1555
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:27,634
If you want them,
you have them.

1556
01:35:27,809 --> 01:35:28,897
- You think I want these?
- Kind of.

1557
01:35:29,071 --> 01:35:31,203
They're a hundred years old.

1558
01:35:31,377 --> 01:35:32,727
Maybe that's your thing.

1559
01:35:38,994 --> 01:35:39,995
I actually--

1560
01:35:52,224 --> 01:35:55,097
It's maybe embarrassing
how long I've wanted to do that.

1561
01:35:55,271 --> 01:35:57,273
Yeah, you should've done that
a lot sooner.

1562
01:35:57,447 --> 01:35:58,709
I know.

1563
01:35:58,883 --> 01:36:01,146
But you could also do it
a lot more times.

1564
01:36:04,193 --> 01:36:05,890
Tara!

1565
01:36:16,248 --> 01:36:18,816
Tara, let's go.
Come on, come on!

1566
01:36:20,296 --> 01:36:22,124
Come on, go, go, go!

1567
01:36:22,298 --> 01:36:24,996
It's Kirby. She's the killer.[Chad] No shit!

1568
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:27,477
- That's locked. Come on.
- Are we trapped?

1569
01:36:27,651 --> 01:36:30,088
She made this whole theater
a kill box. For us.

1570
01:36:30,262 --> 01:36:32,874
Hey, what about that?
There's an exit door.

1571
01:36:33,918 --> 01:36:35,137
Maybe it leads to the roof
or something?

1572
01:36:35,311 --> 01:36:37,139
There's only one way
to find out. Let's go.

1573
01:36:37,313 --> 01:36:38,401
Bailey's on the way, but--

1574
01:36:42,231 --> 01:36:43,493
Oh, fuck!

1575
01:36:45,408 --> 01:36:46,365
Beheadings!

1576
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:49,847
Tara! Come on.

1577
01:36:50,021 --> 01:36:51,893
Smile for the camera,
motherfucker!

1578
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:57,550
This way! Come on!

1579
01:36:57,724 --> 01:36:59,552
<i>She should
be running out the front door.</i>

1580
01:37:05,558 --> 01:37:06,646
Get fucked!

1581
01:37:24,099 --> 01:37:25,927
Tara, go! Go!

1582
01:37:32,977 --> 01:37:34,283
No!

1583
01:37:34,892 --> 01:37:35,893
Chad!

1584
01:37:39,244 --> 01:37:40,593
Run.

1585
01:37:42,508 --> 01:37:43,553
Go.

1586
01:37:53,911 --> 01:37:55,913
This way. Up here. Come on.

1587
01:38:00,352 --> 01:38:01,876
<i>Everybody's a suspect.</i>

1588
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:06,576
<i>You're not scared, are you?</i>

1589
01:38:09,318 --> 01:38:10,885
Oh, Sam!

1590
01:38:11,059 --> 01:38:13,931
<i>It's a lot scarier
when there's no motive.</i>

1591
01:38:14,105 --> 01:38:15,715
Ready?

1592
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,630
I need you to be ready. Ready?

1593
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:19,981
Look at me.

1594
01:38:21,504 --> 01:38:22,853
I'm ready.

1595
01:38:23,027 --> 01:38:25,334
Come on, motherfucker!

1596
01:38:27,945 --> 01:38:29,555
It's okay!

1597
01:38:29,729 --> 01:38:32,428
- Stay the fuck back!
- We know it's you, Kirby.

1598
01:38:33,646 --> 01:38:36,258
One of them knocked me out.

1599
01:38:36,432 --> 01:38:37,346
Kirby, stop!

1600
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,174
Get away from the girls!

1601
01:38:41,132 --> 01:38:42,438
What are you doing?

1602
01:38:42,612 --> 01:38:44,657
Did you kill Quinn?
Did you kill my daughter?

1603
01:38:44,831 --> 01:38:46,224
Jesus Christ!

1604
01:38:48,313 --> 01:38:51,273
Whatever he's been saying
to you, don't listen to him.

1605
01:38:51,447 --> 01:38:53,144
He's probably the killer.

1606
01:38:54,058 --> 01:38:55,538
Behind you!

1607
01:39:05,026 --> 01:39:06,027
Great job.

1608
01:39:10,901 --> 01:39:11,946
Both of you.

1609
01:39:13,773 --> 01:39:15,384
- You?
- Yeah, of course me.

1610
01:39:15,558 --> 01:39:17,864
Frankly, I expected more
from the two of you

1611
01:39:18,039 --> 01:39:19,040
after what you did to us.

1612
01:39:19,214 --> 01:39:20,302
What do you mean, "us"?

1613
01:39:26,003 --> 01:39:27,787
Ta-da!

1614
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:29,528
Mindy was right.

1615
01:39:29,702 --> 01:39:31,617
It was easy to juke
the roommate lottery.

1616
01:39:31,791 --> 01:39:33,315
All I had to do to meet you

1617
01:39:33,489 --> 01:39:36,666
was room with a conceited,
condescending alpha

1618
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,668
literally named Chad.

1619
01:39:38,842 --> 01:39:40,583
Fuck,
it felt good to kill him!

1620
01:39:42,019 --> 01:39:43,803
This was your grandmother's,
Sam.

1621
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:46,023
Nancy Loomis?

1622
01:39:46,197 --> 01:39:48,286
Really runs in
your fucking family, doesn't it?

1623
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:50,549
Speaking of family... Wait for it.

1624
01:39:50,723 --> 01:39:52,638
...my name's
not Ethan Landry,

1625
01:39:52,812 --> 01:39:53,857
is it, Dad?

1626
01:39:55,337 --> 01:39:56,903
"Dad"?

1627
01:39:57,078 --> 01:40:00,037
Wait. If it's you two,
that just leaves...

1628
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:03,998
Mindy?

1629
01:40:12,223 --> 01:40:13,746
Hey, roomies.

1630
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,488
You didn't see
that one coming, did you?

1631
01:40:16,662 --> 01:40:19,926
- Yeah, because you died!
- Kind of didn't, though.

1632
01:40:20,101 --> 01:40:22,581
It was a good way
to get off the suspect list.

1633
01:40:22,755 --> 01:40:24,235
Stab Gale Weathers,

1634
01:40:24,409 --> 01:40:27,151
stab Mindy on the train.
That sort of thing.

1635
01:40:27,325 --> 01:40:29,414
Yep, and I just made sure
I was first on the scene

1636
01:40:29,588 --> 01:40:32,069
so I could switch her body out
with a fresh one.

1637
01:40:32,243 --> 01:40:34,419
Little fake blood, a prosthetic.

1638
01:40:34,593 --> 01:40:37,379
You'd be amazed at what
a grieving father
can get away with.

1639
01:40:37,553 --> 01:40:39,859
I got Stu Macher's mask.

1640
01:40:40,556 --> 01:40:41,644
He was my favorite.

1641
01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:46,257
Nice. That's number three.

1642
01:40:46,866 --> 01:40:47,998
That's two.

1643
01:40:48,912 --> 01:40:49,956
Which leaves...

1644
01:40:51,262 --> 01:40:52,611
your father's.

1645
01:40:54,874 --> 01:40:57,268
This is what we've
been counting down to, Sam.

1646
01:41:00,445 --> 01:41:02,404
I'm gonna need you to put it on.

1647
01:41:04,623 --> 01:41:05,624
Fuck you!

1648
01:41:06,712 --> 01:41:08,932
Ooh!

1649
01:41:09,106 --> 01:41:10,586
Stay the fuck away from her!

1650
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:14,111
Come on.
- What? What is this?

1651
01:41:14,285 --> 01:41:15,547
You did this as a family?

1652
01:41:15,721 --> 01:41:16,809
Hell yeah, bitch!

1653
01:41:16,983 --> 01:41:18,159
You should know
better than anyone.

1654
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:19,682
They're still not getting it.

1655
01:41:19,856 --> 01:41:21,684
I don't know
what you believe,

1656
01:41:21,858 --> 01:41:24,817
but I didn't commit
those murders in Woodsboro.
It wasn't me!

1657
01:41:24,991 --> 01:41:26,602
We know that.
Of course you didn't.

1658
01:41:26,776 --> 01:41:30,040
You think this is based on
some bullshit conspiracy theory?

1659
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:34,436
Come on. Who do you think
started the rumors about you
in the first place?

1660
01:41:36,177 --> 01:41:38,309
Do you know how easy it was

1661
01:41:38,483 --> 01:41:42,313
to turn Sam
from the hero of Woodsboro
into the villain?

1662
01:41:42,487 --> 01:41:45,490
How easy it is
to convince the world

1663
01:41:45,664 --> 01:41:49,668
to believe the worst in people
rather than the best?

1664
01:41:49,842 --> 01:41:53,063
Because it's not enough
to just kill someone these days.

1665
01:41:53,237 --> 01:41:56,240
You have to assassinate
their character first.

1666
01:41:56,414 --> 01:41:59,983
So when Dad here "discovers"
your horribly mutilated bodies...

1667
01:42:01,637 --> 01:42:03,987
...posed with Sam
wearing her father's mask,

1668
01:42:04,161 --> 01:42:07,556
he'll say some poor dumb bastard
read on the Internet
that you're the real Ghostface

1669
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:10,211
and took matters
into their own deluded hands.

1670
01:42:10,385 --> 01:42:13,214
Exactly! That's why
it's the perfect alibi.

1671
01:42:13,388 --> 01:42:16,434
And all the best lies
are based on the truth.

1672
01:42:18,001 --> 01:42:19,133
And you're a killer.

1673
01:42:19,307 --> 01:42:20,917
- Just like your father.
- No, I'm not!

1674
01:42:21,091 --> 01:42:24,573
Yes, you are, you motherfucker!
You killed our brother!

1675
01:42:26,488 --> 01:42:27,750
What are you talking about?

1676
01:42:27,924 --> 01:42:29,230
You said your brother died
in a car accident.

1677
01:42:29,404 --> 01:42:31,232
No, no, no,
you sweet, dumb thing.

1678
01:42:31,406 --> 01:42:33,321
He died in Woodsboro

1679
01:42:34,409 --> 01:42:36,454
at the hands
of your bitch sister.

1680
01:42:47,204 --> 01:42:48,379
You're Richie's family.

1681
01:42:52,209 --> 01:42:53,254
Yeah.

1682
01:42:54,646 --> 01:42:57,432
Ding-ding-ding-ding!
She's finally starting
to get it.

1683
01:42:57,606 --> 01:42:59,912
Now! It wasn't
until I saw that photograph

1684
01:43:00,086 --> 01:43:03,351
of what you'd actually done
to him that I knew.

1685
01:43:03,525 --> 01:43:05,614
That I knew you had to fucking
die! You had to be punished!

1686
01:43:05,788 --> 01:43:08,617
Along with anyone else
who stands in our way.

1687
01:43:11,663 --> 01:43:13,187
There she is.

1688
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:16,407
There's the fucking killer.

1689
01:43:16,581 --> 01:43:17,930
Great parenting job,
by the way.

1690
01:43:18,104 --> 01:43:20,150
Shut your whore
fucking mouth!

1691
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:23,197
Shit.[Sam] You okay?

1692
01:43:23,371 --> 01:43:25,895
Have I been a perfect Dad? No.

1693
01:43:26,069 --> 01:43:28,985
Have I maybe overindulged
Richie's love
of these little movies?

1694
01:43:29,159 --> 01:43:31,292
Yeah, maybe.

1695
01:43:32,423 --> 01:43:33,859
For me,
they're just a little dark.

1696
01:43:34,643 --> 01:43:35,644
But...

1697
01:43:37,776 --> 01:43:39,038
Richie really loved them.

1698
01:43:40,039 --> 01:43:41,215
He loved them!

1699
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:43,869
He even made a few of his own.

1700
01:43:45,131 --> 01:43:46,742
Did you know? Did you know?

1701
01:43:48,744 --> 01:43:51,137
<i>So you think I didn't post
a holiday special.</i>

1702
01:43:51,312 --> 01:43:54,576
<i>Well, I tried to.
I really did try.</i>

1703
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:57,448
<i>That I could interact with.</i>

1704
01:43:57,622 --> 01:44:00,364
There's a very special bond
between a father

1705
01:44:00,538 --> 01:44:02,148
and his first son.

1706
01:44:06,414 --> 01:44:08,154
Which is why I helped him
build this collection.

1707
01:44:09,765 --> 01:44:11,941
This was all his?

1708
01:44:12,115 --> 01:44:14,073
Yes, he's
a very passionate collector.

1709
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:15,553
And he inspired others.

1710
01:44:15,727 --> 01:44:18,034
We had to kill those two
wannabe film students

1711
01:44:18,208 --> 01:44:22,168
because, well,
we had to kill you first, Sam.

1712
01:44:22,343 --> 01:44:26,390
I put the theater in their name,
then good old Detective Bailey
would've just stumbled on it,

1713
01:44:26,564 --> 01:44:28,610
but I didn't have to because,
by golly,

1714
01:44:28,784 --> 01:44:31,787
that Gale Weathers
is one hell of a journalist.

1715
01:44:31,961 --> 01:44:33,832
I built a tribute
to my son.

1716
01:44:35,138 --> 01:44:37,749
Which is why this is
where you have to die, Sam,

1717
01:44:39,098 --> 01:44:41,666
surrounded by all the things
he loved the most.

1718
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,146
What happens next?

1719
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,191
After you're done with us
you just disappear?

1720
01:44:45,366 --> 01:44:47,411
No! We got to hurry
over to the hospital

1721
01:44:47,585 --> 01:44:50,762
and make sure Mindy
and Gale don't pull through.
Because everybody dies, Sam!

1722
01:44:50,936 --> 01:44:54,636
Everyone who had anything to do
with the death of my son
suffers and dies.

1723
01:44:54,810 --> 01:44:55,854
- Fuck yeah, they do!
- Yeah!

1724
01:44:56,028 --> 01:44:57,943
Now put on the mask.

1725
01:44:59,902 --> 01:45:03,384
He was...
...so pathetic.

1726
01:45:05,734 --> 01:45:07,605
- That's not true.
- Yeah, your son,

1727
01:45:08,911 --> 01:45:10,565
he was a man-baby

1728
01:45:10,739 --> 01:45:13,307
who made his girlfriend
do all the killing.

1729
01:45:13,481 --> 01:45:16,092
He was a strong,
virile young man!

1730
01:45:16,266 --> 01:45:17,920
He was a limp-dick
little fuck

1731
01:45:18,094 --> 01:45:19,835
who cried
before I slit his throat.

1732
01:45:20,009 --> 01:45:22,881
Shut the fuck up!

1733
01:45:26,407 --> 01:45:28,322
Sam, come on!

1734
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:32,238
Recognize this?

1735
01:45:32,413 --> 01:45:33,631
Fuck you!

1736
01:45:38,288 --> 01:45:39,855
Sorry,
but I kind of need this.

1737
01:45:42,988 --> 01:45:44,599
Fuck 'em up.

1738
01:45:44,773 --> 01:45:46,165
What are you gonna
do about it, bitch?

1739
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,645
Ow! Fuck!

1740
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:52,607
Sam!

1741
01:45:58,743 --> 01:45:59,788
I'll get help.

1742
01:46:15,151 --> 01:46:16,544
Be careful.

1743
01:46:18,328 --> 01:46:20,112
Come on.

1744
01:46:26,858 --> 01:46:28,643
Go get her.
Get her!

1745
01:46:28,817 --> 01:46:30,775
I can't grab you.[Sam] It's okay.

1746
01:46:30,949 --> 01:46:33,952
I can't grab on.
I can't grab on.

1747
01:46:35,127 --> 01:46:36,128
No!

1748
01:46:37,042 --> 01:46:38,479
No!

1749
01:46:38,653 --> 01:46:40,568
I've always wanted
to stick something in you, Tara.

1750
01:46:40,742 --> 01:46:42,396
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1751
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:52,101
You guys are so fucked now!

1752
01:46:54,103 --> 01:46:55,365
Sam.

1753
01:46:58,150 --> 01:46:58,977
Sam?

1754
01:46:59,151 --> 01:47:00,892
- Let me go.
- No!

1755
01:47:01,066 --> 01:47:03,199
Yeah, let her go, Sam,
come on.

1756
01:47:03,939 --> 01:47:06,115
Fuck!

1757
01:47:06,289 --> 01:47:07,682
Trust me.[Ethan] Fuck!

1758
01:47:15,994 --> 01:47:17,343
You have to let me go.

1759
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:29,268
Gotcha!

1760
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:51,203
Now die a fucking virgin.

1761
01:47:59,647 --> 01:48:01,605
Looks like you're down
another brother.

1762
01:48:11,441 --> 01:48:13,138
Always got to
shoot them in the head.

1763
01:48:20,189 --> 01:48:21,146
Oh, fuck.

1764
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:47,912
<i>Do you see
your boyfriend anywhere?</i>

1765
01:48:48,086 --> 01:48:50,480
<i>I don't even have
a boyfriend right now.</i>

1766
01:48:52,003 --> 01:48:53,614
<i>Would you like one?</i>

1767
01:48:53,788 --> 01:48:56,573
<i>I don't even know you
and I dislike you already.</i>

1768
01:49:07,323 --> 01:49:09,194
<i>Hello, Detective Bailey.</i>

1769
01:49:09,368 --> 01:49:11,370
<i>I've got one question for you.</i>

1770
01:49:12,110 --> 01:49:13,111
Oh, yeah?

1771
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,200
What's that?

1772
01:49:16,506 --> 01:49:18,900
<i>What's your favorite
scary movie?</i>

1773
01:49:19,074 --> 01:49:23,252
"Favorite scary movie."

1774
01:49:23,426 --> 01:49:26,211
<i>I'm asking
because you're in one now.</i>

1775
01:49:27,082 --> 01:49:28,866
<i>You're in my movie.</i>

1776
01:49:35,177 --> 01:49:36,395
Oh.

1777
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:39,007
I see you've
put on your true face, huh?

1778
01:49:40,356 --> 01:49:41,662
Your birthright.

1779
01:49:43,185 --> 01:49:45,317
Poetic that you're
gonna die in it.

1780
01:49:45,491 --> 01:49:47,668
<i>This is what you wanted,
isn't it?</i>

1781
01:49:51,846 --> 01:49:54,979
Now you know the truth, huh?
Murder's in your blood!

1782
01:49:58,113 --> 01:49:59,810
Stop fucking around
and show yourself!

1783
01:49:59,984 --> 01:50:02,552
<i>Be careful what you wish for.</i>

1784
01:50:03,771 --> 01:50:05,773
All right,
I'm a fucking police officer.

1785
01:50:05,947 --> 01:50:07,470
How do you think
this is gonna go, Sam?

1786
01:50:07,644 --> 01:50:09,515
Who do you think
they're gonna believe, huh?

1787
01:50:11,909 --> 01:50:14,346
<i>Probably the one
who's still alive.</i>

1788
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:23,617
No! No!

1789
01:50:52,036 --> 01:50:54,778
My father was a murderer.

1790
01:50:57,215 --> 01:50:59,130
No matter
what you think,

1791
01:50:59,957 --> 01:51:01,742
I'm better than that.

1792
01:51:04,353 --> 01:51:05,484
Thank you.

1793
01:51:07,051 --> 01:51:08,139
Thank you.

1794
01:51:14,493 --> 01:51:16,452
But you did
fuck with our family, so...

1795
01:51:31,772 --> 01:51:33,774
- Nice.
- Thanks.

1796
01:51:35,558 --> 01:51:37,516
You okay?

1797
01:51:42,086 --> 01:51:43,000

1811
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,493
I want you to be.

1812
01:52:41,667 --> 01:52:44,279
I promise you I'm gonna get
so much therapy after this.

1813
01:52:44,453 --> 01:52:46,063
I'm serious.

1814
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:53,767
We're gonna get
through this.

1815
01:52:55,333 --> 01:52:56,334
Together.

1816
01:53:14,439 --> 01:53:16,659
I saw that
in a scary movie once.

1817
01:53:21,882 --> 01:53:23,144
Sam. Hey.

1818
01:53:23,318 --> 01:53:25,624
Two over there.
Let's go.

1819
01:53:34,677 --> 01:53:35,939
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1820
01:53:37,462 --> 01:53:39,595
I thought you might need
some reinforcements.

1821
01:53:39,769 --> 01:53:41,466
And I called Mount Sinai,

1822
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:43,077
and Mindy and Gale
are gonna be okay.

1823
01:53:43,251 --> 01:53:45,906
Mindy's on her way here now.
They couldn't stop her.

1824
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,995
Not bad, Cute Boy.

1825
01:53:48,169 --> 01:53:49,170
Thanks.

1826
01:54:00,746 --> 01:54:03,227
If you ever need me, call.

1827
01:54:03,401 --> 01:54:06,578
We're all part of
the same fucked-up family now.

1828
01:54:06,752 --> 01:54:10,147
And legacy doesn't always have
to be a bad thing.

1829
01:54:11,192 --> 01:54:12,193
Okay.

1830
01:54:15,805 --> 01:54:16,850
Hey.

1831
01:54:19,635 --> 01:54:20,854
It's just Chad.

1832
01:54:24,292 --> 01:54:26,207
Hey, we got another one here!

1833
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:29,079
Watch out, coming through.

1834
01:54:31,299 --> 01:54:33,779
Oh, my God.
- Chad! Chad!

1835
01:54:33,954 --> 01:54:35,259
How are you alive?

1836
01:54:38,959 --> 01:54:40,961

01:54:44,181 --> 01:54:45,400

1838
01:54:45,574 --> 01:54:47,968

1839
01:54:48,142 --> 01:54:49,752
Oh, my God!
Are you guys okay?

1840
01:54:49,926 --> 01:54:52,711
I know who the killer is!
It's Ethan and Bailey.

1841
01:54:52,886 --> 01:54:55,758
- And Quinn.
- And Quinn? Fuck!

1842
01:54:55,932 --> 01:54:57,194

1843
01:54:57,368 --> 01:54:59,196

Are you okay?

1844
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:01,068
You don't look okay.

It's a twist on a twist.

1846
01:55:04,245 --> 01:55:06,029
They gave me a lot of drugs.

1847
01:55:06,203 --> 01:55:07,901
You guys should
get some of these drugs.

1848
01:55:08,075 --> 01:55:09,903
I can't feel anything
below my shoulders.

1849
