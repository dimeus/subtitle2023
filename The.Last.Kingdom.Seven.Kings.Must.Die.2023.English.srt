[folk pop music playing]

7
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,720
[Finan] For a hundred years,
there was chaos in our lands.

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,720
War between Saxons and Dane invaders.

9
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,680
And war between men
who wanted to be kings.

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,200
My lord, Uhtred, son of Uhtred,
born a Saxon, but raised a Dane,

11
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,920
had brought about a fragile peace.

12
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,040
But as King Edward's health faltered,

13
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
trouble spread.

14
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,920
And while most of the country
was sworn to the Saxons,

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,240
Uhtred's land of Northumbria was not.

16
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,200
And enemies were keen to exploit this.

17
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,840
Wolf!

18
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,240
Wolf! [grunts] Wolf!

[screams]

20
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,760
Destroy the settlement.
Leave no sign we have landed.

25
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,480
[warrior] Anlaf, we have the spy.

[chuckles]

27
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,560
Behold my child.

28
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,280
Behold the daughter of Anlaf.

29
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,440
You look ridiculous.

30
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,120
It is how they dress, Father.

31
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,840
If I'm to hide amongst them,
I must appear--

32
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,600
Is King Edward dead?

33
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,720
Not yet.

34
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,920
-But each breath could be his last.
-Then we chose our moment.

35
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,080
A king dies,
Saxons always turn on each other.

36
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,440
Pass this news to all kings who hate them.

37
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,040
Tell them I have crossed from Irland
and wish to make allies.

38
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,880
Return yourself to Winchester.

39
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Wait.

40
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,240
Play with them.

41
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,840
Unleash chaos.

48
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
[Aldhelm] Lady Eadgifu,

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,680
the traitor Aelfweard has sent men to take
you and Prince Edmund into protection.

50
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,600
[swords scrape]

51
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
I have no wish to be a hostage.

52
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,360
-Can we fight them?
-Not without Aethelstan.

53
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,760
Well, surely, my guards can--

54
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,360
Loyalties are shifting
and factions forming.

55
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,200
It is not certain who supports us.

56
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
We should flee with your son
whilst we can.

57
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
[Eadgifu] I will not forgive this.

58
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,480
Nor forgive Aethelstan
for leaving us exposed.

59
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,360
Damn him for his absence.

60
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,200
Come, Edmund. We are leaving.

61
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,840
-[soldier 1] Where's the queen?
-[soldier 2] Move! Look everywhere!

62
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,840
-[Edmund] Mother, what's--
-[Eadgifu] Sh. Quiet.

63
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,880
-Wait.
-[footsteps approaching]

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,120
-[Eadgifu] Pyrlig.
-[Pyrlig] We got word.

65
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,840
Aethelstan has gone on pilgrimage
to pray for his father's health.

66
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,040
Then find him and tell him of his death.

67
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,160
Then strike him, from me,
for he swore to protect us.

68
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,200
[Aldhelm grunts] Come. There's no time.

69
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
[sword rings]

70
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,400
[Pyrlig] Where will you go?

71
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,680
-To Uhtred.
-The pagan?

72
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,680
-[soldier] They're in here!
-[Aldhelm] Go! Go!

73
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
[grunting]

74
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
[Eadgifu] Uhtred betrayed my husband.

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,240
Are we sure this is wise?

76
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,360
Uhtred was like a father to Aethelstan.
He can be trusted.

77
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,640
We go to the last kingdom.

78
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
[ethereal music playing]

79
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,680
[jolly chatter]

80
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,600
[Finan] He stood in front of the army,
and he said, "Release the arrows!"

81
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,840
And an arrow went right through his head.

82
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,200
[laughter]

83
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,080
[Finan] Oh, that was something.

84
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,440
But then, the battle for this place
certainly sticks in the memory.

85
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,000
-Both times.
-[Finan] Hey. Cnut.

86
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,680
He was a proper… cock!

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,840
Then there were the horse-killers.
Oh, they were deadly.

88
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,440
-What was his name?
-Bloodhair.

89
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,600
Bloodhair. And what was her name?
She of the curses?

90
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,800
Do not remind me. [belches] Skade!

91
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,800
Now, she was moon touched.

92
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,880
Another one who thought she was a seer.
It didn't go well for her.

93
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,160
I am telling you, my dream was a prophecy.
Three nights I have had it.

94
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,880
-And what is your dream, Ingrith?
-[Finan] Don't get her started, Lord.

95
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,520
-Hear my words. "Seven kings must die."
-[man] Lord?

96
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,920
-Seven kings and--
-Ingrith!

97
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
[dark music playing]

98
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,000
All stand for the queen!

99
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,200
Queen Eadgifu.

100
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,520
And my most noble friend, Lord Aldhelm.

101
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
What brings you this far north?

102
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
I come seeking refuge with my son.

103
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,400
Edward, rightful king of these lands,
has died.

104
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,720
Then my heart grieves.

105
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,080
I'd hoped to reconcile.

106
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,680
One down, six to go.

107
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,440
No! I do not like it.

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,040
Northumbria recognizes the new king,
Aethelstan.

109
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,200
Do not assume Aethelstan will be king.

110
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,480
-Who is supporting Aelfweard?
-[Aldhelm] The ealdormen of Wessex.

111
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,920
Of course.
Still claiming Aethelstan's a bastard?

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,120
Yes. Aelfweard has
the wealth of Wiltunscir behind him.

113
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,720
Our spies in Aegelesburg say he's there,
openly recruiting mercenaries.

114
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,440
We will go to Aegelesburg and seize him
before he is at full force.

115
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,200
We would prefer your guard.

116
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,880
My offer gives Aethelstan the time
to go to Winchester to be crowned,

117
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,400
and we avoid a clash of armies.

118
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,280
I swore an oath to protect Aethelstan--

119
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,840
And of course, you are a man of your word.

120
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,680
Yet your oath to swear your lands
to the king remains unfulfilled.

121
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Your husband showed himself
hostile to those of Danish blood.

122
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,320
As such, he was not the right man
to unite England.

123
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,240
If he had been, England would be united.

124
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,240
[Aldhelm] But now things can be different.

125
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
Aethelstan can be the king
to fulfill the Saxon dream.

126
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,480
If he chooses to swear--

127
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,360
I swore an oath of loyalty, and it stands.

128
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,720
If Aelfweard is buying mercenaries,
he will be looking for men from all parts.

129
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,120
Do you think
we can still execute an ambush?

130
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
If it is for Aethelstan, then yes.

131
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,360
-If he does not fall asleep.
-Once. I fell asleep once.

132
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,920
Are you certain this is better
than a band of young fighters?

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,160
I hear you do little these days
but feast and hunt.

134
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,640
I will not send young men
to do a task I swore to do myself.

135
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
[disconcerting music playing]

136
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,240
-[horse whinnies]
-[Finan] Come on, you little…

137
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,600
Come on! Come on.

138
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
-[horse whinnies]
-[Finan] Stop it now.

139
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,960
Osbert! What news from our borders?
Do the Scots behave themselves?

140
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes, Father. There are rumors
Wolf-Warriors landed near Derwent.

141
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,680
-Wolf-Warriors?
-Why are you carrying your sword?

142
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,240
We're riding
to protect Aethelstan from his brother.

143
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,240
Then I will come.

144
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,240
-Any fight of yours is mine.
-Stay here and protect your birthright.

145
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,600
No good comes
of sitting waiting for a birthright.

146
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,040
So you train the horses

147
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,880
and you teach that boy
how to defend himself.

148
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,440
No one likes the third son of a dead king.

149
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,080
Father.

150
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,760
-Will you swear our lands to Aethelstan?
-I must honor my word.

151
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,120
Northumbrians will be sad
to lose their pagan lord.

152
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,480
-[Finan grunts]
-[horse whinnies]

153
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,480
[Finan] Gotcha!

154
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,800
-Look at this little bastard.
-Are we ready?

155
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,920
[Sihtric] He's complaining
about his saddle.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,720
-Says his arse gets sore.
-[Finan] Didn't say arse. I said my back.

157
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,840
[Ingrith] I made you this.

158
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,240
[scoffs]

159
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,240
And one for each of you.

160
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,560
Men who sit on cold earth
find the cold earth calls for them.

161
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,840
Once again, she shows herself a seer.

162
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,880
Lord, it was nothing.

163
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,800
Tell it again.

164
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
"Seven kings must die," Lord.

165
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,000
-"Seven kings--"
-Ingrith, no.

166
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,920
Go on.

167
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
"And the woman you love."

168
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,920
I'm no king, and I have no woman.

169
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,920
-It means nothing.
-[Aldhelm] Lord Uhtred.

170
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,600
I told my son to train yours.

171
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,560
While you are here,
take Wassa as your serving woman.

172
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,480
-Make this fortress your home.
-I wish to say one thing of Aethelstan.

173
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,240
He is not quite
the carefree boy you raised.

174
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,600
He has grown very much into his faith.

175
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,480
The Brotherhood of Oswald
exert great influence.

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,880
I have scared off such men before.
For some reason, monks find me terrifying.

177
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,160
[foreboding music playing]

178
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,800
-[Uhtred] Let's go play kingmaker.
-[Finan] Once again.

179
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,400
[Aethelstan] My father?
No, that cannot be.

180
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,680
I thought God had given him the winter.

181
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,520
[Pyrlig] Lord Aethelstan, you should
make haste to Wessex for coronation.

182
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,800
Your brother gathers men.

183
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,160
Establish yourself at Winchester
before he raises an army.

184
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,560
We will leave when God commands us
to leave, Father Pyrlig.

185
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,760
And that command has not been given.

186
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,480
Return when you have prayed.

187
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,760
[Aethelstan] Do I depart?

188
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,080
[Ingilmundr] Only the book has answers.

189
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,120
Play.

190
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,400
You have been guided
to the Book of Matthew, verse 157.

191
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,760
"Then Jesus went thence and departed
into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon."

192
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
God wants you to fight.

193
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
Oh. Thank you, lady.

194
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,040
[sentry] Halt. State your business here.

195
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,440
We heard a man is looking for fighters.

196
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,680
We come to make some coin.

197
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,040
[sentry] Mm.

198
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,360
Go on.

199
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,840
-This place has fallen to shit.
-[Uhtred] Edward left it to decline.

200
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,160
I'm glad Aethelflaed
is not here to see it.

201
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,680
[chatter]

202
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,320
Huh.

203
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,840
Word has spread.

204
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,160
[Sihtric] I swear
I've fought half these men.

205
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,200
[Finan] This is not someone
trying to recruit.

206
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,840
This is preparing for a battle.

207
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,520
[Uhtred] That is the youth Aelfweard.

208
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,160
Go see what men know of his plans.

209
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,440
[man] I'll show you a sword!

210
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,600
[teen] Oh!

211
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,720
Ooh.

212
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,120
-Is that amber in your sword?
-How much do you want for it?

213
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
[groans]

214
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,600
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.

215
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,520
[groans]

216
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,400
-[Uhtred] Go home to your mothers.
-[teen 2] Edgar! No.

217
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,600
Wilfrid!

218
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
Wilfrid!

219
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,680
Do you speak to me, friend?

220
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,880
Your pardon. I thought you were Wilfrid.

221
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,840
A great man I fought with at Tettenhall.

222
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,120
Wait, you were at Tettenhall?

223
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,680
My father was there.

224
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,640
-Who do you fight for now?
-Aelf… something?

225
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,320
-Saxon names are much alike.
-The Aelf who marches on Wessex?

226
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
You haven't heard.

227
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,320
No one's marching on Wessex.

228
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,920
I'm told the new plan
is to lure Aethelstan here.

229
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,040
Aethelstan is on his way.

230
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,920
Aelfweard challenged him to battle,
and he's accepted.

231
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,160
Why would he agree to that?

232
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,960
Because he's young,
and they've baited him.

233
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,120
They plan to snare him between the gate
and men hidden in the hills.

234
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,880
Then we take control before he arrives.

235
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,280
We can't seize this town
with just us, Lord.

236
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,640
We do not need to seize the town.

237
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
[eerie music playing]

238
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,000
[Finan snores]

239
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,480
[grunts]

240
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,840
[Finan] Hey! Can I tempt you
to play for money, friend?

241
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,560
-[sword rings]
-[grunting]

242
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,960
[Uhtred] Tie them up and secure the bolt.
Stay low until Aethelstan arrives.

243
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
[Finan] If there's a bed, it's mine.

244
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
[birds singing]

245
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
[eerie music continues]

246
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
[Finan snores]

247
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,480
[Uhtred] He's here.

248
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,160
[guard in distance] Raise the alarm!
Soldiers approach the southern gate!

249
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,120
[Aelfweard] Come no further!
Aegelesburg is loyal to me now.

250
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,560
We do not negotiate with bastards.

251
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,920
Nor do we surrender.

252
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,080
-You'll have to starve us out.
-I am not foolish, brother.

253
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
I assumed you would place a trap.

254
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,520
Perhaps delay me here until your forces
could attack at rearguard.

255
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,960
Show him what's left of his men!

256
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,720
[grunting]

257
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,000
[Aethelstan] You can yield now,

258
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,200
or we destroy the gate
and kill all your men.

259
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,800
The gates will hold. No yield will come.

260
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,760
[Aethelstan] Then you will be destroyed.

261
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,160
Get ready to open the door.

262
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,880
[Aelfweard] I am the rightful king.
Your mother was a whore.

263
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,840
All good men know it. You have no allies.

264
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,640
Lord Aelfweard.

265
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,480
-I'm Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
-Uhtred.

266
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,920
[Uhtred] You know me
as a man who speaks the truth,

267
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,800
so hear me when I say,
for the common good, stand down.

268
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,520
My men control the gate.
You're outnumbered on all sides.

269
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,480
Yield.

270
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,040
Let this end with peace.

271
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,320
[Aethelstan] Give yourself to me, brother.

272
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,240
Then it is over.

273
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
[somber music playing]

274
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,560
Forgive me for my failings,

275
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,240
and give comfort to my mother's kin.

276
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,200
Tell them of my exile

277
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,160
and how we sought
to honor our discarded bloodline.

278
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,960
-For Wessex!
-[men] For Wessex!

279
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,880
Lord Uhtred,

280
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
open the gate.

281
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,760
-[slicing]
-[Aelfweard grunts]

282
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,040
-No!
-[Aethelstan] God chose me rightful heir.

283
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,000
[squelches]

284
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,640
[Uhtred] Aethelstan!

285
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,920
[Aelfweard groans]

286
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,440
[men shout]

287
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,360
[intense music playing]

288
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,480
Advance!

289
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,000
[shouting]

290
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,720
Leave no enemy alive!

291
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
[commotion]

292
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,840
[Finan] Lord, stop this madness!

293
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
[Uhtred] Stop!

294
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,600
[grunting, groaning]

295
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,560
[Uhtred] Aethelstan!

296
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,960
[grunting]

297
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,120
[Sihtric] Get back! Hide!

298
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,560
-[mercenary] I submit! Please don't--
-[grunts]

299
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,000
Aethelstan!

300
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,960
[mercenary] Please, show mercy!

301
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,960
[Uhtred] No!

302
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,840
Stop! They're surrendering!

303
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,360
Aethelstan!

304
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,920
-Aethelsta--
-[high-pitched ringing]

305
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,040
-[muffled cries]
-[Uhtred grunts]

306
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,160
Ah!

307
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,160
-Ah!
-[ringing fades]

308
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,800
[man] Lord! Lord, help us!

309
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,960
Aethelstan!

310
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,840
Aethelstan!

311
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,480
-Stand down your men.
-[Aethelstan] Uhtred, why are you here?

312
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,480
[Uhtred] To stop this.
Your enemy has surrendered.

313
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,760
Halt your men.

314
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,120
-Let him approach and call a halt.
-[guard] Yes, my lord.

315
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,880
-What happened to you?
-What happened to you?

316
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,280
-You had no need to kill your brother.
-I did, or in time, he would return.

317
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,880
-You dishonored your word.
-I did not.

318
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,440
I told him to yield.
I did not say he would survive.

319
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,800
It was never our plan to let him live.
Lord, reverse the order.

320
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,320
We are close to routing them.

321
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,720
-Hired men have no quarrel with you.
-You were right not to seek his help.

322
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,320
You kill 100 fathers,
you give 300 sons a reason to defy you.

323
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,320
Think!

324
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,760
Now's the time to unify.

325
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,200
Uhtred may be right in this matter.

326
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,560
I speak only as a man
who has made mistakes before.

327
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,240
-I'm Uhtred of--
-I know who you are.

328
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,120
[Aethelstan]
Uhtred, this is Lord Ingilmundr.

329
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
A great commander
and a great friend to me.

330
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,160
Then a friend to me.

331
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,400
Why the Danish name?

332
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,160
Born to a Dane, but raised a Saxon.

333
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,160
I found Christ
through the works of Alfred,

334
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,840
and indeed through the writings
of your son in Rome.

335
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,080
You must be proud of him.

336
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,080
He is a true scholar.

337
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,240
I'm just the fool who made him.

338
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Ingilmundr holds the garrison
at Thelwael on the Wirral.

339
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,320
He knows many of the people
we knew from Rumcofa.

340
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Good people.
I should like to see them again.

341
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,920
[Ingilmundr] Yes. Perhaps after
you've sworn Northumbria to the new king.

342
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,440
Honor your word.

343

518
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,400
This peace may not sustain.

519
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,200
Lord Uhtred has snubbed the king.

520
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,440
The women Uhtred has affection for
become a target for his enemies.

521
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,360
-[Uhtred] Sihtric!
-Sh-sh.

522
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,800
[Uhtred] What have you learnt?

523
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,520
Aethelstan has claimed Eoferwic.

524
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,280
He says since Rognvaldr is dead,
there is no king, so it belongs to him.

525
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,720
Eoferwic?

526
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,240
They see me as their lord now.
Aethelstan knows this.

527
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,080
He is demanding all come with tribute.

528
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,720
Not just Saxon chiefs,
but all kings of Britain.

529
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,480
All the mainland
and all the outlying islands.

530
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,040
Lord?

531
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,600
Declare yourself king here.

532
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,560
Like your forebears.

533
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,680
No. This is Aethelstan.

534
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,120
If he chooses the wrong path,
I must tell him.

535
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,720
[Sihtric] Lord.

536
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,080
[foreboding music playing]

537
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,560
"There went out a decree
that all the world should be taxed."

538
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,200
You owe no tribute!
Return to your villages.

539
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,320
-Uhtred! Calm yourself.
-Pyrlig? What is this tribute?

540
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,240
He says it is to build churches,
but, please, there are spies everywhere.

541
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,560
Tell your arseling apprentice
he's badly misjudged the mood of Scotland.

542
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,880
You seem upset.

543
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,640
We came to renew our treaty.

544
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,920
Instead, we've been left waiting for days,
only to be told we are supplicants.

545
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,240
I would be careful.

546
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,280
We've had other offers of alliance.

547
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,120
-Why is Aethelstan doing this?
-He says to unite Christians.

548
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,040
And in his prayers,
he talks much of atonement.

549
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,400
Atonement? For what?

550
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,400
The death of his brother,
the bastardy of his parentage?

551
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,240
I do not know.

552
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,960
Lord Aldhelm and I try daily to dissuade,

553
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,960
but there is talk of conquest
and forced baptism.

554
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
-Where is he?
-The Devil's Stones.

555
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,440
He thinks he fights the devil.

556
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,600
[Uhtred] This is madness. Aldhelm.

557
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,480
These stones have stood for generations.

558
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,800
They are an insult to God, apparently.

559
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,000
Is that Owain, King of Strathclyde?

560
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,520
[Aldhelm]
Aethelstan wanted him to witness it.

561
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,280
They were built by his forebears.

562
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,200
He is seeking to humiliate powerful men?

563
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
[Uhtred] King Hywel.

564
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,360
He dares ask submission from Wealas?

565
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,160
After all you did for Mercia?

566
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,040
What choice do I have, Uhtred?

567
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,400
He took my son to Winchester.

568
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,520
-He is keeping your son hostage?
-You take the son, you take a future king.

569
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,640
-Now I am forced to follow his bidding.
-I will tell him this cannot stand.

570
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,440
King Hywel, I swear,
Wealas's faithfulness will not be spat on.

571
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,280
Our poets spoke this.

572
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,800
That a Saxon would break us all
to build their country.

573
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,040
This is not just a Saxon country.

574
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,200
Aldhelm, get me close to him.
I will stop this.

575
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,840
[guard] Halt. Stay back.

576
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,640
[Aldhelm] Step aside!
The king requested Uhtred speak with him.

577
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,280
King Aethelstan!

578
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,320
[Uhtred] Lord King,

579
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,840
let me speak with you alone.

580
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,040
[Uhtred] You should not
have stepped on my land.

581
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,520
You should not have broken your word,
humiliated me,

582
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,160
as you humiliated my father.

583
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,880
I'm trying to make you see
you're on the wrong path.

584
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,560
-You do the bidding of Ingilmundr--
-I do the bidding of the Lord.

585
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,920
Do you really seek to convert Danes?

586
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,480
-Did I teach you nothing of respect?
-Many Danes welcome the Lord.

587
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,000
-Those in my court thank me for it.
-Many do not wish it, and you know this.

588
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,560
Aethelstan, you've always known it.

589
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,200
-Even Alfred respected this.
-I have more to atone for than Alfred.

590
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,640
Who tells you this? Ingilmundr?

591
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,480
Does he tell you
you are damned without his guidance?

592
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,800
For I've seen before men under the spell
of those who claim to know the gods.

593
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,840
He has been a great friend to me.

594
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,960
Aethelstan, hump who you wish,

595
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,840
but do not fall under the influence
of those who seek power--

596
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,520
Who makes such vicious claim against me?

597
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,560
-No one.
-Who tells such lies?

598
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,400
-It has not been talked of.
-Lord Aldhelm, does he spy for…

599
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,640
What has been said,
by who, and for how long?

600
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,520
No one has said anything.
I care not for that, but for you.

601
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,200
Aethelstan, you are a kind man,
but you are tenderhearted,

602
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,160
and Ingilmundr is seeking power
for himself and for his brotherhood.

603
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,640
Lies. Lies and ignominy.

604
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,080
There's no ignominy.
He just turns you from your kin.

605
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,920
And you are turned from your king!

606
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,280
You seek to be one yourself.

607
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,760
Lord, they consecrate the ground

608
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,040
and would request you
to give the blessing.

609
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,920
Yes, of course.

610
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,440
Let us leave the King of Northumbria
to think on his errors.

611
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,240
I have no dream to be a king.

612
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,120
Only to protect you.

613
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,520
Like you ran to protect him in Aegelesburg
and ended up being beaten by boys?

614
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,240
Should he really take counsel from a man
who loses his sword to a child?

615
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,880
Northumbria needs a lord
with lust for battle.

616
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,720
There are rumors Anlaf has arrived
and will come Viking.

617
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,240
Do not think he will spare you
just because you follow the same gods.

618
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,880
Keep him here a night
and make him swear at dawn.

619
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,840
In time, you will come
begging for his help.

620
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,240
As all fathers fall,

621
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,200
and all sons take their place.

622
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,120
[disconcerting music playing]

623
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,400
Sh.

624
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,120
Lord Ingilmundr has declared you
an enemy of God

625
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,040
to incite his followers to kill you.

626
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,720
Aethelstan would not allow it.

627
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,920
Which is why Ingilmundr
seeks to keep his hands clean of it

628
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,200
and has left the camp.

629
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,080
To go where?

630
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
[Aldhelm] This way.

631
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
Go up and around. There's no guard.

632
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,000
Him. That is the man.

633
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,880
What did you speak of with the pagan?

634
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
[agitated music builds]

635
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,480
[sentry] Horsemen approach!

636
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,720
[Osbert] Stay back from my gates
and tell me who you are.

637
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,000
Lord Ingilmundr,
and I come at Lord Uhtred's request.

638
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,240
He's delayed in Eoferwic
as he renews his vow to the king.

639
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,360
He asked I help protect you.

640
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,800
Protect from what?

641
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,040
There is a rumor of Wolf-Warriors
landed near Derwent.

642
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,000
[guard] Open the gate! Open the gate!

643

[music fades]

645
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,520
Do not give the order.

646
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,800
Think on all we have shared.

647
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,000
You're lost from yourself, Aethelstan.

648
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,480
We fought together--

649
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,000
And despite this, you drip poison
against me and plot with Uhtred.

650
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,960
-No.
-Yes.

651
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,280
-No.
-Yes!

652
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,160
You turned your back, Aldhelm.

653
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,640
Now I turn mine.

654
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
[haunting vocal music playing]

655
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,160

[rope tightens]

658
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,160
[Eadgifu] Lord Ingilmundr,

659
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,920
you bring welcome news
of Lord Uhtred's supplication.

660
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Will you journey south with me
to let me bear witness to it?

661
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:37,040
Lady, we have ridden hard to get here.
At least let us rest a day or so.

662
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,680
Oh, but I have been trapped in Bebbanburg
a good while.

663
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,800
Believe me, you do not want to find
yourself here longer than intended.

664
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,080
[horse grunts softly]

665
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,120

-[Finan] Now!

00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,120
[grunting]

667
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,920
We overtook you on the road.

668
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,640
Whatever power you hold over Aethelstan,

669
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,320
today it ends.

670
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,520
[Ingilmundr grunts] My sword!

671
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,920
[groans]

672
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,480
[Uhtred chuckles]

673
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,360
You still believe in Valhalla!

674
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,680
Aethelstan cares for you.
I will not divide us further.

675
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,840
Put him below.

676
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,360
Christians amongst you, defend me!
Who is your Lord?

677
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,040
Lord Uhtred or the Lord Jesus Christ?

678
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,760
The people of Bebbanburg
will not be divided by faith.

679
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,800
Rise up, you fools!

680
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,640
Tell the king the terms of his release.

681
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,800
He makes peace with Northumbria
and guarantees the border.

682
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,680
-No one is forced to follow his god.
-Yes, Lord.

683
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,600
Quite a price.

684
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,680
-Will Aethelstan agree?
-[Uhtred] Let us hope so.

685
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,400
He seems to discard his friends
rather quickly now.

00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,360
[Ingilmundr] Truly, you bless
an unworthy soul.

688
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,840
[water drips]

689
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,880
-May God reward your kindness.
-Amen.

690
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,520
[determined music playing]

691
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,640
[Anlaf] Aethelstan turns
against his friends.

692
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,760
Succumbs to a wild dream
to be a monarch for all your land.

693
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,560
In time, he will come for you, Shetland.

694
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,560
You, Orkney.

695
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,680
He will take what belonged
to your forebears and call it Britain.

696
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,440
[Shetland] No.

697
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,280
He barely sets his foot upon the water.
Saxon country folk.

698
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,240
We can repel them.

699
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,200
I'm not talking of repelling,
but of meeting conquest with conquest.

700
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,760
[Domnal] Scotland rejects your offer.

701
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,760
We cannot join with pagans
to attack a man who's not threatened us.

702
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,440
Christians do not choose war.

703
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,960
War is coming.

704
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,120
You only have to choose a side.

705
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,040
[whispering]

706
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,920
[Ingilmundr] God be with you.

707
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,080
-[gentle music playing]
-[birds singing]

708
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,360
[rustling]

709
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,760
[Wassa] The stone was rolled away,
as in the scripture.

710
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,680
It can only be the work of an angel.

711
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,440
This way, Lord.
Come and see the treasures.

712
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,360
[Sihtric] Lord!

713
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,200
What word from Eoferwic?

714
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,760
Does he accept my terms?

715
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,440
I have no news.

716
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,520
Aethelstan is said
to have returned to Winchester.

717
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,080
Well, let us take it as a good sign.

718
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,680
Perhaps without his shadow,
Aethelstan sees more clearly.

719
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,120
[Sihtric] What trouble
brings you out here?

720
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,360
[Finan] The villagers were
hunting for pagan silver.

721
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,200
Now they're saying it's a miracle.

722
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,800
[Wassa] Make way
for the King of Northumbria.

723
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,200
I told you.

724
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,200
They think of you as a king.

725
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,520
[Finan] Do you think
they hope to keep half for themselves?

726
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,800
[Sihtric] They likely took it
from Bebbanburg in the first place.

727
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,240
[man] You are detained
in the name of King Aethelstan.

728
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,240
[Finan] Lord.

729
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,120
[sinister music builds]

730
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,520
We've been lured here.

731
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,240
You think?

732
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,400
[Wassa] Lord, I'm sorry!

733
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,840
I'm sorry, Lord.

734
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,600
The prisoner told me I had to,
or I'd burn in the fires of hell.

735
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,920
I will never order to open the gates.

736
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,440
[man] Really?

737
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,360
A gift from the king.

738
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,640
Oh.

739
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,480
Aethelstan did this?

740
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,200
It's what he does to traitors.

741
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,560
Open the gates or I slaughter your father.

742
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,120
Comply and he will be spared.

743
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,160
Do not open.

744
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,000
-I can kill him in front of you.
-Do not open!

745
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,000
-The choice is yours.
-[Uhtred] Osbert! Do not open!

746
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,440
In your absence, Father, I command here.

747
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,040
And I command that we open.

748
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,800
-No!
-[Sihtric] No, no, no!

749
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,680
[guard] Drop your sword.

750
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,600
Move.

751
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,880
No.

752
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,960
Where is Aethelstan?

753
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,600
In time.

754
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,800
Bring me the Lady Eadgifu.

755
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,760
Come. [grunts]

756
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,120
[Eadgifu] I can walk.

757
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,920
[Eadgifu] Go on.

758
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,080
Kill me.

759
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,640
[Ingilmundr] You are to be placed
in the community on Lindisfarne

760
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,920
to protect your virtue.

761
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,720
[grunts softly]

762
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,160
Did you hump the heathen, Lady?

763
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,720
Confess.

764
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,880
I confess

765
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,160
to have prayed
for your excruciating death.

766
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,960
A no, then. You should have tried
when you had the chance.

767
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,360
We're taking your son to my garrison

768
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,600
at Thelwael
where he will be trained for battle.

769
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,840
No. No. Please.

770
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,560
-[guard] Move!
-Your son also.

771
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,680
[Eadgifu] No.
Edmund is the blood of Alfred.

772
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,000
He should not be fodder for a shield wall!
Please!

773
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,960
-[Osbert] I will take care of him.
-Please!

774
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,680
[Eadgifu gasps breathlessly]

775
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,320
The son of Uhtred stands for Wessex.

776
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,560
[grunts]

777
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,360
Ah.

778
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,400
[Finan] Hey! Hey!

779
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,120
Whoa.

780
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,200
You, we have a plan for.

781
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,920
-[Uhtred] Am I to be drowned in the sea?
-[Ingilmundr] I never quite know his mind.

782
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,760
[Uhtred] Do not punish
those in Bebbanburg.

783
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,560
-His fight is with me.
-His fight is elsewhere.

784
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,880
How lucky we have found ourselves
so close to the Scottish border.

785
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,600
No, do not invade Scotland.
You will lose hundreds of men.

786
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,240
And unleash a war for generations.

787
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,600
The king has no successor to fear for.
It makes him strong.

788
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,880
Do whatever you must to protect our sons.
Do not fight him. Just capitulate.

789
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,280
Anything else is foolish.

790
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,840
-Aldhelm never betrayed you.
-All of you betrayed me.

791
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,280
All those I thought as friends.

792
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,000
Swear now, before Bebbanburg,
and I will spare your life.

793
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,200
-No.
-Then you leave me with no choice.

794
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,640
[sword rings]

795
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,040
-[shrill chords droning]
-[bass drum pounding]

796
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,000
Aethelstan.

797
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,240
[music building]

798
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,160
I cannot.

799
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,840
-Let me offer my--
-No.

800
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,960
Take everything from him.

801
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,680
I banish you from my lands
to travel the earth and seas alone.

802
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,960
On pain of murder of your son.

803
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,720
Let none feed or clothe him,
lest become my enemy.

804
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,920
Go.

805
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,880
Before this mercy vanishes.

806
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,520
[music builds dramatically]

807
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,160
[Hywel] Turn back. There is still time.

808
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,440
The Scots are no threat.

809
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,360
This will damn you, Lord King.

810
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,280
[screaming]

811
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,320
[Hywel] To save us from the pagans
can be a just endeavor.

812
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,800
But to turn on other Christians
is ungodly.

813
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,000
[yelling]

814
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,480
[breathes raggedly]

815
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,120
[Hywel] Your men do not want this fight.

816
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,320
[Aethelstan] Well, perhaps
I need better men.

817
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,360
Perhaps I should summon your son.

818
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,160
Lord King!

819
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,320
Aethelstan has attacked settlements
in the lowlands.

820
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,640
He cannot raid us without reply.

821
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,360
Do I tell Anlaf you are ready
to meet with him and the other kings?

822
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
[yelling]

823
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,640
[shaky panting]

824
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,200
[erratic buzzing]

825
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,320
[grunts]

826
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,480
Uhtred the Daneslayer.

827
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,280
You killed my cousin Gelf
at the battle of Beamfleot.

828
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,120
[echoes] …the battle of Beamfleot.

829
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,640
Send word we have found him.

830
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,840
I hated Gelf.

831
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,360
[echoes] Gelf, Gelf…

832
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,720
Take him to the king.

833
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,720
[Uhtred] Where are you taking me?

834
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,720
[woman] To the very north
of these islands.

835
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,800
[rhythmic music playing]

836
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,560
[pained singing]

837
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,640
[commotion]

838
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,360
-[Uhtred] What do you give thanks for?
-For the great battle to come.

839
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,080
Tell the jarl we're here
with the King of Northumbria.

840
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,280
[warrior grunts]

841
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,320
[shouting]

842
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,520
-[Uhtred] All folk of Shetland?
-[woman] Some of Man and Orkney join us.

843
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,120
With their kings. [chuckles]

844
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,120
[whooping]

845
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,880
[talking softly]

846
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,400
[Anlaf] Is this who they claim?

847
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,160
The King of Northumbria?

848
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,520
[Constantin] Aye, it's him.

849
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,840
-I am no king.
-[Anlaf] No.

850
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,280
But you could be.

851
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,000
Sit. You are amongst friends.

852
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,120
[Uhtred] You join with pagans?

853
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,680
Aethelstan has taken an axe to the truce.

854
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,080
A truce you brokered.

855
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,520
What he has done
in the villages of the lowlands--

856
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,800
-Is it worse than his cruelty in Irland?
-Tales to spread fear.

857
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,920
[Constantin] We had no choice
but to defend ourselves.

858
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,880
We did not start this.

859
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,680
-How did you find me? Who's your spy?
-We have many spies. We know many things.

860
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,000
[Constantin] We know
Aethelstan has banished you.

861
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,080
And we know he gets humped like a woman.

862
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,880
That may be customary to you pagans,

863
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,920
but as a Christian, it cannot be endured.

864
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,560
-He endures it often, from what I hear.
-So…

865
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,560
As a man who shares our enemy,

866
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,120
we ask you to join with us, Uhtred,
in our alliance.

867
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,800
Stand against the tyrant.

868
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,440
I'm heartsick of battles.

869
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,120
What has become of the warrior?
Do you no longer yearn for Valhalla?

870
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,240
Do you know the prophecy, Uhtred?

871
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,400
The ancient prophecy of my people?

872
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,440
All of Britain
will unite against the Saxons,

873
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,320
push them into the Kentish sea,

874
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,160
return the feals to the line of Arthur.

875
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,360
[Anlaf] There.

876
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,400
The vision of an old man.

877
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,960
-So it must be true.
-We Northumbrians also have a prophecy.

878
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,080
"Seven kings must die."

879
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,720
That holds no fear.

880
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,280
Each man here has a son to take his place.

881
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,920
[Owain] Seven kings die,

882
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,680
seven will, in that moment, be made.

883
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,800
[Anlaf] It's true.

884
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,800
If you make a child,
your kingdom stands beyond you.

885
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,080
A kingdom ravaged by war, yes.

886
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,160
[Constantin] Then there is another way

887
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,840
to consider.

888
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,640
If you wish to save many from bloodshed.

889
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,000
Kill one man only.

890
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,520
Kill the king who has attacked us all.

891
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,440
Return to him in… supplication.

892
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,160
Seize the moment.

893
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,240
Save many lives by simply taking one.

894
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,480
[Anlaf] The alternative,
of course, is war.

895
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,240
Seven kings against one.

896
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,120
If Aethelstan wanted to unite
the tribes of Britain,

897
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,120
he has succeeded.

898
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,760
[triumphant music playing]

899
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,920
[Anlaf] Why do you seek us here?

900
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,040
Your part is to keep Winchester aroused.

901
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,160
You let Uhtred go free. Why?

902
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,000
I sent him away.

903
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,080
To kill your friend, the king.

904
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,080
-Well, he will be killed in the attempt.
-[woman chuckles]

905
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,920
Uhtred has skills you do not.

906
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,240
He attacks Aethelstan.
Aethelstan attacks him.

907
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,480
It barely matters.

908
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,880
Either way, we face in battle
men whose spirits have been broken.

909
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,880
Ingilmundr, go to the West.
The time is near.

910
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,600
Astrid, watch our friends in Northumbria.

911
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,680
[ominous music playing]

912
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,040
[door opens]

913
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,520
[footsteps approach]

914
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,200
[Aethelstan] I did not think
I would see you again.

915
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:38,920
Lord King.

916
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,520
In the name of my son, I beg forgiveness.

917
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,680
Spare him.

918
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,400
Let me kneel to you.

919
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,520
[sighs]

920
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,360
Then I lift your banishment.

921
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,640
Give me a sword and then leave us.

922
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,040
Go on, then.

923
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,680
Do it.

924
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,560
I swear this on my son's life.

925
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,400
Hear this as an oath.

926
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,520
Ingilmundr is a spy.

927
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,000
He's working with Anlaf
to ally British kings against you.

928
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,320
-Lies.
-It is true. I saw him in Shetland.

929
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,240
He told Anlaf's warriors to track me.
They tried to turn me--

930
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,800
No! [grunts]

931
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,560
-He is in Thelwael with your son!
-He told them things of you.

932
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,520
[grunting]

933
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,520
He still follows my gods.

934
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,480
[sword clatters]

935
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,880
For now, you have an advantage.

936
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,640
Ingilmundr does not know
he has been discovered.

937
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,040
[Aethelstan] No, he would not betray me.

938
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,720
If anything, I have betrayed him.

939
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,400
-No.
-He is a man of God, and I am a sinner!

940
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:00,800
He has convinced you of this
to provoke your campaign.

941
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,640
-To unite your enemies.
-No!

942
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,800
Aethelstan, please see this. This alliance
he has gathered is too large.

943
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,320
-Your lands will be overrun.
-No! You lie!

944
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,520
This is all lies!

945
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,440
Aethelstan, please hear me.

946
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,680
Why would I lie to you?

947
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,320
-Get out.
-Aethelstan--

948
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,840
Get out. Get from my sight! Guards!

949
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,320
-[door opens]
-Take him!

950
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,440
[grunting]

951
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,600
[breathes heavily]

952
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,520
Ah!

953
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,640
[guard] You dog! On your way.

954
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,320
[Sihtric] We search every forest,
every valley.

955
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,320
[Finan] And here he is,
back in the lap of luxury.

956
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,360
We heard you needed us.

957
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,560
Truly the gods smiled at me
to give me such friends.

958
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,960
[Finan] Let's find ourselves an alehouse,

959
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,440
make a plan.

960
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,520
-Who told you I was here?
-[Sihtric] She said you called for us.

961
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,920
-Did you not send for us, Lord?
-She said you needed us.

962
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,040
And requested a guard.

963
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,240
Danish girl, serves in Aethelstan's court.

964
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,480
Finan, I sent no word.

965
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,400
No command for you to leave Bebbanburg.

966
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,120
[unsettling music playing]

967
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,360
-[Sihtric] Stay here and guard the gates.
-[man] Yes, Lord.

968
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,520
[Uhtred] Wolf-Warriors.

969
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,680
[Uhtred] This is Anlaf's doing.

970
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,480
[Finan] Ingrith!

971
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,480
[breathes shakily]

972
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,600
[Sihtric] Lord, where are they all?

973
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,520
[breathes shakily]

974
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,560
-[Uhtred] Eadgifu?
-Uhtred.

975
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,040
What happened?

976
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,480
[Eadgifu] When news reached us
of the attack and torture here,

977
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,880
the abbess sent us to help the injured.

978
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,280
But we cannot get to the injured.

979
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,240
Where… Where is she? Where's my wife?

980
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,600
"Seven kings must die," Lord.

981
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,400
"Seven kings

982
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,520
and the woman you love."

983
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,000
Ingrith!

984
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,960
-No. Ingrith!
-Every man is to help move it.

985
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,120
You, up above.

986
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,880
-[Finan] Can anyone hear me?
-[Uhtred] Watch for signs of Anlaf's men.

987
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,440
We tried to help,
but all we could do was comfort them.

988
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,280
Uhtred, Ingrith said
they threatened to return.

989
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,400
-We must secure ourselves.
-Not until we rescue those within.

990
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,720
When did you speak last?

991
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,880
About three days ago.

992
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,520
-[Finan] Get the rope up there!
-[man grunts]

993
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,640
[Finan] Come on!

994
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,000
[melancholy choral music playing]

995
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:41,960
[Finan] Pull!

996
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,080
[straining]

997
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,280
[Finan] Pull!

998
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,280
Pull!

999
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,040
[straining]

1000
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:54,960
Pull!

1001
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,520
Now!

1002
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,600
Finan.

1003
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,440
Where is…

1004
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,160
[in anguish] No!

1005
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,240
[choral music continues]

1006
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,720
[Uhtred] I brought this on them.

1007
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,240
What they suffered is on Anlaf's account.

1008
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,520
You cannot let this break you.

1009
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,400
We are broken.

1010
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,640
We have no allies. We're lost.

1011
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,200
Then we must find the courage
to defend Northumbria from their return.

1012
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,720
If we endure and keep them at siege,

1013
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,960
we will give those
in other parts of England time to prepare.

1014
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,080
Whatever we suffer

1015
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,600
protects those we are apart from.

1016
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,960
[Sihtric] She's right, Lord.

1017
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,240
Osbert can cross the Irish Sea, get to--

1018
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,280
The Irish Sea?

1019
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:07,560
We must find the fastest horses. I think
Anlaf is hoping to turn all eyes here.

1020
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,040
To lure Aethelstan.

1021
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,560
But they will land where they have men.
Ingilmundr holds a garrison in the Wirral.

1022
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,000
With… With our sons.

1023
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,440
[frenetic music playing]

1024
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,320
[blows horn]

1025
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,040
[Osbert] Something's underway.

1026
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,080
[men chat]

1027
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,480
[man 1] I'm ready.

1028
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,560
[man 2] Take care.

1029
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,640
-[men shouting]
-[Osbert] Get in the cart.

1030
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:23,080
Those of you with swords to your throats
face a decision.

1031
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,840
A thousand ships
are heading towards these shores.

1032
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,840
Some have already landed.

1033
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,680
Within a week,
Saxon boroughs will be overrun.

1034
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,680
Join us and fight the tyrant Aethelstan,

1035
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,400
or die.

1036
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,360
[soldier grunts]

1037
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,600
For King Ed--

1038
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,440
-[blows landing]
-[swords scraping]

1039
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,280
-[Osbert] Keep still.
-[man] This way!

1040
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,920
[woman] Yes, sir. I believe so.

1041
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,800
We saw them, but they got away.

1042
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,200
-There. Far away.
-Thank you.

1043
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,520
[woman] Yes, my lord.

1044
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,280
[Sihtric] No word from Thelwael, Lord.

1045
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,880
[woman] Told them all I knew.

1046
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,800
Sihtric.

1047
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,600
Lord?

1048
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,360
Do we finally face defeat?

1049
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:41,480
All the warrior kings that I've known,
Ubba, Cnut, Bloodhair,

1050
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,120
all have faced defeat in the end
and have taken others with them.

1051
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,480
The fight was always coming, Lord.
No warrior dies a peaceful death.

1052
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,760
She saw it all. "Seven kings must die."

1053
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,800
We have hope.

1054
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,000
In your heart,
you never wanted to be a king.

1055
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,320
[Eadgifu] Have those fleeing
heard anything of my son?

1056
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,160
Then until I know for sure,

1057
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,400
he is alive.

1058
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:32,640
And if conquest is easy, perhaps
Anlaf may be satisfied with Mercia.

1059
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,520
-It is fertile--
-[Uhtred] He will not be satisfied.

1060
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,640
They come Viking now
to extinguish an idea of England.

1061
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,200
A dream unites a people
who once sought to kill each other.

1062
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,520
Without it, we go back
into an age of darkness.

1063
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,600
[solemn music playing]

1064
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,240
We have both lost so much.

1065
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,600
But I ask myself…

1066
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,120
am I alive?

1067
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,080
Can you feel it?

1068
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,600
[Uhtred] You are alive.

1069
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,080
So are you.

1070
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,960
So we have hope.

1071
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,240
[tense music builds]

1072
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,040
[Uhtred] Edmund?

1073
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,520
Osbert?

1074
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,240
[Eadgifu] Edmund?

1075
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,440
[jarring piano chord plays]

1076
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,120
I came seeking Ingilmundr.

1077
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,920
To prove that you had lied to me.

1078
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,760
But you had not.

1079
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,920
[Uhtred] We came to search for our sons.

1080
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,920
Bring out Osbert and Edmund.

1081
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,880
[jarring chord plays]

1082
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,400
[music pounding]

1083
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,880
[Eadgifu gasps, sobs]

1084
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,600
[Uhtred] Osbert!

1085
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,560
[Aethelstan] They hid themselves
and were spared the massacre.

1086
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,800
[Eadgifu] Lord King,

1087
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,120
you have my endless gratitude.

1088
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,960
[Aethelstan] I've not been myself
this past year, and truly,

1089
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,000
truly, I…

1090
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,840
I pay for my sins.

1091
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,280
I face a great alliance at Brunanburh.

1092
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,160
All regret is worthless.

1093
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,480
Let us speak only of the fight to come.

1094
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:31,720
-Osbert, what have you learnt?
-They've set up camp on high ground.

1095
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,280
And they have six armies.

1096
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,960
Then seven armies
shall meet at Brunanburh.

1097
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,040
I do not want you to fight for me, Uhtred.

1098
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,440
-[Uhtred] Trust I'm on your side--
-I know that.

1099
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,280
Save yourself.

1100
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,840
Take your son to safety.

1101
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,800
If I do not survive the battle,
then succession will be secure.

1102
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,440
You cannot fight this alliance alone.

1103
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,560
[Aethelstan] Yet I forbid you
from taking part.

1104
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,360
Take him, Father Pyrlig.
Please, take them all.

1105
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,720
-I've dragged you all to this fate.
-[Uhtred] Let us serve you.

1106
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,280
Aethelstan…

1107
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,200
this is not a punishment.

1108
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,200
I think we both know that it is.

1109
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,640
[Uhtred] This is martyrdom.

1110
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,400
He will not survive so great a number.

1111
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,480
But we have been reprieved.

1112
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:26,400
-God is telling us to get to safety.
-Your god does not speak to me.

1113
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,440
It is not cowardly
to spurn a battle that cannot be won.

1114
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,560
It is.

1115
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,200
However this prevails, I will have to know
I walked away from danger.

1116
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,640
Your battles will come

1117
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,440
when you become king.

1118
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,600
King of where, Mother?

1119
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,720
-We will fight with the shield wall.
-No.

1120
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,640
-Osbert, are you ready?
-I've always been ready.

1121
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:50,640
Pyrlig, you once told me
that it was my destiny to save England.

1122
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:54,480
Hadn't seen it quite like this,
but then I'm not one for prophecies.

1123
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,240
[Eadgifu] What if your destiny
is to protect Edmund?

1124
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,760
Perhaps he is the one to unite England.
He could be the king who was worthy.

1125
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,720
No king will form England.

1126
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,600
This is what I see now.

1127
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,280
Not Edmund or Edward or Alfred.
Not even Aethelstan.

1128
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,920
Alfred's dream was of a united people.

1129
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,840
And with these men,
from all parts, I fought for it.

1130
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,240
What if our destiny
was not to form England,

1131
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,520
but to form the English as one force?

1132
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:30,680
Who better than a half Saxon, half Dane
to lead men from divided places?

1133
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,120
[Uhtred] We go!

1134
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,240
I don't have to call myself English, do I?

1135
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,760
[harsh music playing]

1136
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,840

[music fades]

1141
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,400
To hear that,
you'd think they'd won already.

1142
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,120
-[trees rustling]
-[distant animals calling]

1143
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,560
[metal scraping]

1144
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,360
[Uhtred] We should make our way.

1145
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:43,160
If this is to work,
we need to be on the front line.

1146
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,040
-We'll aim for their left side.
-Why?

1147
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,040
Why the left?

1148
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,600
Weaker. Most men fight
with the sword in their right hand.

1149
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,240
I've fought with Uhtred many times.
Trust he will find a way.

1150
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,680
You.

1151
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,120
Where did you find that?

1152
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,760
I bought it in Aegelesburg
for five pieces.

1153
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,560
May I?

1154
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,600
I will exchange it for this one.

1155
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:40,120
It is worth much more,
and it has a garnet.

1156
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,280
When I say exchange, I mean
you take that one, and I keep this one.

1157
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,120
[Uhtred] I am no commander of yours.

1158
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,960
I have no authority other than being
a man who has fought in many battles.

1159
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,400
Some of you I have led before.

1160
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,240
Today I stand with you
as a simple soldier.

1161
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,640
But I ask that, on the field,

1162
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,840
you once again let me guide you.

1163
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,080
Our position on the hill is weak,

1164
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,800
but the trees to our left give us
an advantage the enemy will not see.

1165
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,520
We can defeat them

1166
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,800
if we stay united.

1167
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,880

[soldier grunts]

1170
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:50,240
-This is one way to clear the ale.
-Smell of a thousand armpits.

1171
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,240
[Finan] Aye.
Maybe they smelled us and ran away.

1172
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,840
-[Sihtric] Maybe.
-[Finan] Who touched my arse?

1173
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,640
[laughter]

1174

Oh my God!

1177
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,440
[soldier] Jesus!

1178
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,760
[cheering]

1179
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,280
Rather a lot of them, isn't there?

1180
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,920
[rival soldiers jeering]

1181
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,400
[Edmund] Uhtred?

1182
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:53,920
Uhtred.

1183
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,760
-How do we face this?
-You see these bags?

1184
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,000
Give them to the men
on the front line. Go.

1185
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,560
[yelling]

1186
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,680
[Uhtred] Do not raise your shield
until you have to.

1187
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:14,240
Stay at ease. Stay relaxed.

1188
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,520
-And do not show them we are unsettled.
-[Finan] Lord!

1189
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,240
He's here.

1190
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,040
[Anlaf] Here he comes. The tyrant himself.

1191
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,880
[Uhtred] Is it done?

1192
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,280
-Get back as far as you can.
-Yeah.

1193
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,560
[commander] Shield wall!

1194
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,640
[shields rumble]

1195
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,800

[agitated music playing]

1197
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,440
-Are we ready, arselings?
-[soldiers] Yeah!

1198
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,240
I have taken their confessions.

1199
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,840
When I ask you to give ground,

1200
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:39,880
do it.

1201
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,960
When you see the trees in front of you,
it will be time.

1202
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,320
Do you think this will work?

1203
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,760
If it does not,
we will not be here to see it.

1204
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:50,640
Trust me.

1205
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,640
And follow.

1206
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,960
Shield wall!

1207
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,920
Shield!

1208
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,160
Wall!

1209
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,200
[soldiers grunt]

1210
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,240

1212
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:12,680
Back!

1213
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,480
They retreat?

1214
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,960
Even before we engage?

1215
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,320
-Step back!
-[Anlaf] They know they have lost already.

1216
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,120
Let's enjoy it.

1217

-[commander] Forward!
-[soldiers grunt]

1218
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:30,480
I thank God,
who I serve with pure conscience.

1219
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,400
God hath not given us a spirit of fear,
but of power…

1220
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,680
-[soldiers grunt]
-…love…

1221
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,000

1222
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,040
[Finan] Amen.

1223
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,400
[rhythmic grunting continues]

1224
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,720
[Uhtred] Step back!

1226
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,600

[groans]

1228
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,400
[commander] Re-form! Charge!

1229
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,800
Saxon bastards!

1230
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,720
[Uhtred] Pyrlig!

1231
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,640
No! [echoes]

1233
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:50,440

[grunting]

1235
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,400
-Two paces! One pace!
-Mm-hmm.

1236
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,720
-On my command!
-[Finan] Let's hope this works!

1237
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,160
Two paces back!

1238
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,080
Back!

1239
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,400
Step back!

1240
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,720
One pace back!

1241
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,720
[Anlaf] They back off. We have them.

1242
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,160
[shouts]

1243
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:29,360
-Find the king!
-[Anlaf] Find the king!

1244
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,760
[grunting]

1245
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,600
Step back!

1246
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,400
[Sihtric] Go backwards!

1247
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,640
For Shetland!

1248
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,080
For Orkney!

1249
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,600
Step back!

1250
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,360
-Keep going!
-Keep going!

1251
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:03,360
[Finan] Back!

1252
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,480
Protect the line! Protect the line!

1253
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,080
Step back!

1254
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,760
[Finan] They'll overrun us
if we keep giving ground!

1255
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,480
What are they doing along the flank?

1256
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,800
[Constantin] Send a message
that Aethelstan is in front of us!

1257
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,560
Step back!

1258
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,760
Step back!

1259
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:30,280
[Finan] The line's turning, Lord.
We're coming around!

1260
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,680
Aethelstan is on the Scots' line, Lord.

1261
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:34,120
Swine wedge!

1262
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,640
Step back!

1263
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,800
[Anlaf] Swine wedge!

1264
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:50,000
[Constantin] Anlaf! Stop!

1265
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,640
Push forward!

1266
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,800
They're going for Aethelstan!

1267
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,320
Step back!

01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,320
Back!

1270
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,280
The wall will not hold!

1271
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:19,000
[Uhtred] Aethelstan, hold the line!

1272
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,840
-[Finan] How much longer, Lord?
-[Uhtred] We're almost there.

1273
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,360
[strains]

1274
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,640
They're breaking through
Aethelstan's line, Lord!

1275
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,800
[Finan] We can't hold!

1276
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,000
Step back!

1277
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,240
Push forward!

1278
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,640

1279
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:43,440
[Ingilmundr] Lord!

01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,240
Lord.

1281
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,920
[Hywel] Protect the king!

1282
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,480
[Uhtred] Aethelstan!

1283
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,320
[Finan] Lord, trees!

1284
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,720
We've turned them, Lord!
We've turned the line.

1285
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,240
-[Uhtred] Give the signal!
-[runner] Yes, Lord.

1286
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,560
-Something's not right.
-[Domnal] We've been turned around!

1287
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,400
[runner] Make way! Make way!

1288
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,520
Lord Uhtred orders the signal.

1289
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,560
Attack!

1290
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,160
Yah!

1291
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,360
Behind!

1292
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,920
Hunt down their kings!

1293
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,160
It's a trap!

1294
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,160

1298
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,240
No!

[horse whinnies]

1300
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,040
Guards!

1301
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,440
Fall back! Fall back!

1302
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,880

[Finan] Five kings
escaped the field that day,

1315

but their sons,

01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,600
Orkney, Man, Shetland,

1317
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:49,200
Strathclyde, and Scotland, did not.

1318
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,560
[Constantin] Each man here

1319
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,520
has left behind an heir.

1320
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,720
We wait.

1321
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,080
Then attack those leaving the field
and return for our kin.

1322
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,480
[Shetland] Do not be
any more foolish, Anlaf.

1323
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,200
[Anlaf] Shetland?

[Orkney spits]

No more death.

[Anlaf] Orkney, we need to fight!

1327
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:14,000
What is there to fight for?

1328
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,560
I need a ship to get back to Irland.

1329
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,600
You?

01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,240
Hey. Hey, you.

1335
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,920
[Sihtric] Finan! Finan!

[Aethelstan] Was any of it real?

1339
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,360
Tell me the truth.

1340
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,600
When you find yourself before God,
you will have confessed.

1341
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,600
I grew fond of you.

1342
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:52,120
-But my love for my people prevailed.
-I chose you over my people.

1343
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,880
Perhaps my gods are stronger than yours.

1344
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,320
Then why am I living…

1345
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:03,920
and you about to die?

1346
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,960
Only fools try to understand destiny.

Uhtred.

1354
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:10,720
Did my son survive?

1355
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,640
Yes.

1356
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,040
[Osbert] And Bebbanburg is ours again.

1357
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:23,520
-We will rebuild in stone.
-[Eadgifu] There is so much future.

1358
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,960
Stay with us, Uhtred.

1359
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,040
-What of the enemy?
-[Finan] The victory is ours.

1360
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:34,560
Five sons of kings
lay dead upon the battlefield.

1361
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:39,240
-Five kings that will never be crowned.
-[Finan] "Seven kings must die."

1362
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,040
The prophecy was wrong, Lord.

1363
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:44,680
With Edward of Wessex, it makes six.

1364
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:47,600
Am I to be the seventh?

1365
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:52,440
I have told the chroniclers
to write of your victory, Uhtred.

1366
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:55,240
I have no wish
to be written into your history.

1367
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:00,680
I want only to be honored
in the feast hall for standing by an oath.

1368
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,360
Uhtred, you did not just stand by me.

1369
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,280
You stood for me.

1370
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,520
You led where I could not.

1371
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,320
And you forgave me

1372
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,120
when I was unforgivable.

1373
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,600
You saved the hope of England.

1374
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:41,200
Now in time, it may yet happen.

1375
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,120
I said that…

1376
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,680
if you proved yourself
to be the rightful king,

1377
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,360
I would swear Northumbria to you.

1378
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:00,040
Men have died
fighting under the name of the English.

1379
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,000
To honor them, England should be formed.

1380
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,560
But I have one condition.

1381
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,600
You must make an oath never to marry.

1382
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,360
No heirs.

1383
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:20,480
So your brother Edmund
can take the throne unchallenged.

1384
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:30,760
Thank you.

1385
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:47,840
This oath

1386
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,840
I shall swear.

1387
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,080
Then we submit to you as our king.

1388
01:44:55,160 --> 01:45:00,120
Which makes you ruler
of Wessex, Mercia, East Anglia,

1389
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,360
and Northumbria.

1390
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,240
And I call my lands

1391
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,680
England.

1392
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:13,760
Long live the king!

1393
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,440
[all] Long live the king.

1394
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:18,520
[Uhtred] Long live the King of England.

1395
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,640
Return to your chamber, Lord.

1396
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,240
Do not grieve for me.

1397
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:34,240
It was always written
that I would fall in battle.

1398
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,080
[Finan] You're not gonna die, Lord.

1399
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:39,680
-I would go first, and I'm still alive…
-[distant cheering]

1400
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:43,960
So,

1401
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:46,760
destiny is all.

1402
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:50,760
[distant cheering]

1403
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,640
[cheering continues]

1404
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,200
[cheering continues]

1405
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:19,960
[chanting]

1406
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,720
-Skál!
-[revelers] Skál!

1407
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,800
[emotional music playing]

1408
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,360
[Finan] Did seven kings die?

1409
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,200
The chronicles do not record
if my lord Uhtred survived.

1410
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,720
But those like me, who knew him,

1411
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,120
recognize him
as the greatest warrior of our age,

1412
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,440
and a man who made a kingdom.

1413
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:07,440
[song ends]

1414
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:10,600
[ethereal music playing]
