1
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,833
Congratulations, Pancho!

2
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:09,083
Who would've thought
someone with your shady background

3
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,541
would get so far, and become
the corporate general manager.

4
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:13,791
Cheers!

5
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,458
- Cheers.
- To success in your new position.

6
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:20,541
Thanks, Don Jaime, but I owe it all
to you and your trust in me.

7
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,916
Nonsense! You earned it in your own right.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,291
It's a shame your family couldn't be here
on such an important day.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,666
I would love to meet them
and congratulate them in person.

10
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,625
You might not remember,
but I told you a while back

11
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,500
that my parents passed away
when I was an only child.

12
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:42,666
My only family is my dear Mari
and my beautiful children.

13
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,125
You don't need much else, my boy.

14
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,458
Your wife's a hot piece of ass.

15
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,916
You truly hit the jackpot.
She's pretty much the reason

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,166
you've been losing your tackiness,
and small town ways.

17
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,750
Isn't that right, Mariquita?

18
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,166
Thanks, Don Jaime.

19
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,875
Dinner is served, please take your seats.

20
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,000
Go ahead.

21
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,750
- Monsignor, please.
- Please, go ahead.

22
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,166
Thanks.

23
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,375
- Your napkin, dear.
- Sorry, my love.

24
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,083
Thank you.

25
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,750
Enjoy everyone.
We hired an excellent caterer.

26
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,250
Try the foie gras, sir

27
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,458
and the Jabugo ham is to die for.

28
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,625
Are we expecting anyone?

29
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,875
Honey, did you invite anyone else?

30
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:26,791
Sir?

31
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,000
There are two men at the door
asking for you.

32
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,583
They say they're relatives,
but they're really ugly and they stink.

33
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,333
I'm sure there must be
some kind of mistake.

34
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,333
Don Jaime, give me two minutes
to sort this out.

35
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,250
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

36
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,208
Check it out, Pops!

37
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,750
I figured this son of a bitch
was swimming in cash,

38
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,750
and that's why he's forgotten about us.

39
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,208
Do you know them?

40
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,583
Do you know this pair of shabby scumbags?

41
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,166
Who, them? No, I've never met them.

42
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,250
Listen up pals! This is private property.

43
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,666
If you don't fuck off right now,

44
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,083
I'll call my bodyguards to kick you out!

45
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,375
LÃ³pez probably sent them
to ruin the party.

46
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,333
Listen up, dandies!

47
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:10,708
First person that moves
gets pumped full of lead!

48
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,333
Pops, I've told you, no one
calls them dandies anymore.

49
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,583
That was back in your day.
Like the President says,

50
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:20,000
these fuckers
are privileged conservatives.

51
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,625
To me, they're the same scum
that derailed the Revolution.

52
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,000
Dad! Grandpa!

53
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,916
This isn't the time.

54
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,958
Let me send my guests home,
and we'll talk this through.

55
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,250
Screw your guests.

56
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,875
The only way they're leaving
is in a body bag!

57
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,875
Stop the nonsense!

58
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,875
Friends, let's not get caught up
in the intolerance and polarization

59
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,791
promoted by this populist government.

60
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,833
If it's money you want, I have plenty.

61
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,666
I'll give you as much as you want.

62
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,625
- Take your money...
- Yes.

63
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,166
- ...roll it up...
- Yes?

64
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,000
And stick it up your ass.

65
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,458
Please get a grip on Grandpa.
Dad, I'm begging you.

66
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:02,083
- You're going to ruin my life!
- Ruin your life, Panchito?

67
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,958
Look how you've treated us,
ungrateful bastard.

68
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,583
The whole family made sacrifices
to put you through college,

69
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,458
and look how you've repaid us.

70
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,958
Twenty years of neglect and abandonment!

71
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:17,125
All the while living the high life
at our expense, huh?

72
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,083
All right, Rosendo.
Quit being such a pansy.

73
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,375
Take them to the back,
let's get this over with!

74
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,500
Yes, Pops. Come on, move it!

75
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,041
You too, blondie! Move your asses!

76
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,708
- You're staying right here.
- Panchito, come with me.

77
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,083
- Come on, hurry.
- Wait, no!

78
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,000
Go on, move it!

79
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,916
Back to the wall!

80
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,041
Now, face the firing squad!

81
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,583
Dad, Grandpa...

82
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,666
I realize I've been
an ungrateful, lousy son,

83
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,916
but I swear that from now on,
things will be different.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,500
What's mine will be yours,
and I will never abandon you.

85
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,833
Too late, Panchito.

86
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,625
The hour of revolutionary justice
has come for you.

87
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,791
The poor come first now!

88
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,083
- Blindfold him, Rosendo.
- Sure, Pops!

89
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,250
Please don't!

90
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,958
Please, Dad. I'm begging you.

91
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,666
Think of my children.

92
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,250
You've always been so good to me.

93
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,250
Sorry, Panchito.

94
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,291
When you had the chance
to help us, you didn't.

95
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,833
It's time for you to pay
for all your bullshit.

96
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,250
By the way, your mother
and siblings send their love.

97
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,583
Thank you.

98
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,375
- Ready, Rosendo?
- Yes, Pops.

99
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,708
Ready!

100
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,250
Aim!

101
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,041
Fire!

102
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,708
Fran? Fran!

103
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,625
Pancho!

104
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,708
Having one of your nightmares again?

105
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:57,250
Oh, Mari, you have no idea
what a horrible dream I had.

106
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,541
- Your family, again?
- Yeah.

107
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:04,083
I've told you a thousand times,
you need to see a therapist.

108
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,000
This isn't normal.
Now, let me get some sleep

109
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,041
before your alarm goes off.

110
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,750
Yeah, I could use some sleep myself,

111
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,208
I have a big day tomorrow.

112
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,250
Good morning.

113
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,416
- Morning, Dad!
- Good morning, Lupita.

114
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,750
I'm meeting with Don Jaime,
I can't be late.

115
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,333
- Can I fix you something?
- Just a coffee, real quick.

116
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,375
How do I look?

117
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,500
A little tired, but super handsome.

118
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,583
- So handsome, Daddy!
- Thanks, sweetie.

119
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,458
Why do you keep wearing
those shoes with that suit?

120
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,625
The black Ferragamos look so much better.

121
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,500
I don't have time to change,
what can I say?

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,125
Fix your shirt, it looks wrong.

123
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,250
Hello? Yes, this is the residence
of the Reyes family.

124
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,083
Who?

125
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,291
Oh, one moment.

126
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,708
Sir, it's for you.
Says he's your dad, Rosendo.

127
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,541
He says it's important.

128
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,750
No, tell him I'm not here.

129
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,916
Tell him you don't know when I'll be back.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,583
Lupita, whatever you do,
don't give him my cell phone.

131
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,708
Got it?

132
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,333
Mr. Rosendo?

133
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,666
Mr. Pancho left for work,
he's not sure when he'll be back.

134
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,791
No, I don't have his personal number.

135
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,541
Oh.

136
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,208
Don't worry, I'll tell him for you.

137
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,125
Okay, then. Goodbye.

138
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,000
He says it's an emergency,
something about your grandpa.

139
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,833
He wants you to call him back.

140
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,666
Such bad timing

141
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,583
- This is the last thing I need.
- Do you know what he wants?

142
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,666
He probably wants money,
but I can't deal with him today.

143
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,500
I would've liked to talk with Grandpa.

144
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,333
Some other day, champ.

145
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,875
- Bye, family! See you later.
- Bye, Daddy!

146
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,833
- Have a nice day, sir.
- Bye!

147
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,500
This is what I've been saying,
all this area is filthy,

148
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,083
so this guy over here...

149
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,291
Missed a spot. How's the A-4?

150
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,541
- Fantastic, sir.
- Perfect.

151
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,708
How is this machine still out of order?

152
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,291
Why haven't you fixed it?

153
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,750
Good on supplies? Perfect.

154
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,958
<i>Mr. Reyes, your father is calling for you.</i>

155
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:32,958
<i>Mr. Reyes, Mr Reyes</i>,
<i>your father is on hold.</i>

156
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,083
Good morning. Raise your hand
if you can hear me.

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,083
Thank you.

158
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,708
Colleagues, as all of you know,
the economic situation is dire

159
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,250
for the country and our factory.

160
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:54,708
Despite our efforts and sacrifices
to stay ahead of this situation,

161
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:59,166
only Mr. Sampaolo's generosity
has kept us afloat.

162
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,583
Unfortunately, the situation
has become unsustainable.

163
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:07,166
We only have two options
if we hope to stay in business.

164
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:12,041
Either we move the plant
and its subsidiaries to Asia,

165
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:17,333
or we could opt for a drastic,
yet necessary downsizing.

166
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:23,916
Appealing to your solidarity
to your colleagues,

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,750
I ask that you raise your hand
to volunteer for early retirement.

168
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,541
All right, since no one is taking
the company's generous offer,

169
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:46,208
I will be selecting
those who will be laid off.

170
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,625
AlcÃ¡ntara, Tiburcio.

171
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,750
BojÃ³rquez, Ignacio.

172
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,500
CÃ¡rdenas, CuitlÃ¡huac.

173
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,708
<i>Mr. Reyes, Mr. Reyes.</i>

174
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,666
<i>You have a call from your father</i>.

175
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,000
- Damn it.
<i>- Mr. Reyes.</i>

176
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:12,000
<i>You have a call from your father</i>.

177
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,875
Please!

178
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,208
Colleagues, please.

179
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,875
Congratulations, Pancho.

180
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,958
Thanks to you, productivity
is off the charts.

181
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,791
- And profits are higher than ever!
- Thank you, Don Jaime.

182
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,875
- How many did you sack today?
- Another 40.

183
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,083
Honestly, I don't think
there's any more fat to trim.

184
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,375
There always is, Pancho.

185
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,708
Once the new machines
from Germany get here,

186
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:43,125
we'll be able to cut an extra
ten percent off those parasites.

187
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,250
Another 180 employees out on the street?

188
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,958
I hope the union
doesn't threaten a strike.

189
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:55,375
Those commie troublemakers
from the union can suck my dick!

190
00:10:55,458 --> 00:11:01,291
Now that our populist president
keeps gushing over the poor,

191
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,500
they're starting to think
they can make demands.

192
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,291
Yes, Licha?

193
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,250
<i>Mr. Sampaolo, sorry to interrupt.</i>

194
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,666
<i>Mr. Reyes' secretary is here with me.</i>

195
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,333
<i>She says she urgently needs
to speak with him.</i>

196
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,375
Send her in, Licha.

197
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,750
Good afternoon, Don Jaime.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

198
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,833
Mr. Reyes, your father
has been calling all morning.

199
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,625
He needs to talk to you,
it's a life-or-death emergency.

200
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,916
Don't worry, I know my dad.
I'm sure it's nothing.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,291
Tell him I'm not here,

202
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,416
and next time I'm in a meeting
with Mr. Sampaolo,

203
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
do me a favor, never interrupt me.

204
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:47,250
Certainly, sir. Once again,
I'm sorry to bother you.

205
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:51,333
You can bother me whenever
you want, gorgeous.

206
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,416
I can't promise not to spank you, though,

207
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,250
or maybe even bend you
over my desk, kitten.

208
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,125
Are you tapping that ass, fucking Pancho?!

209
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,833
- No.
- She's smoking hot,

210
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,083
and anyone can see she needs a good fuck.

211
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,125
No way, Don Jaime.
Not in this day and age,

212
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,833
when you can get accused of
sexual misconduct over nothing.

213
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,791
All that bullshit about #MeToo,

214
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,541
and anti-harassment policies
can suck my dick.

215
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,541
That's why I'm the boss, don't you think?

216
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,375
Yeah, of course.

217
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,500
What's this about your family?
I thought you were an orphan.

218
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:36,333
No, you must be mistaking me
for someone else.

219
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,250
I'm sure that my father is overreacting.

220
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,625
My family thinks I'm rich,

221
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:45,291
so they're always hitting me up for money.

222
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:49,541
Tell them to fuck off!
My poor relatives are the same.

223
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,416
I'll always remember
what my father used to say.

224
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,875
"From the family and the sun,
the farther, the better."

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,625
What was I saying before
your slutty secretary came in?

226
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:06,625
That's right, I was saying
I'm sick of this government,

227
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,875
and its EcheverrÃ­a-era populism.

228
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,333
I might as well sell the plant
to the gringos,

229
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,166
or move the entire operation
to China or Singapore.

230
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,166
- I even had budgets drawn up.
- No way, Don Jaime.

231
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,375
Don't even joke about that.
It's just... how should I put it?

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,208
I haven't paid off my mortgage yet.

233
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,625
Don't worry about that.

234
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,208
Despite your dubious social background,

235
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,625
you're one of us now.

236
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,333
If you keep up the good work,
and learn English and Mandarin,

237
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,416
I might just promote you
to general corporate manager.

238
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,458
General manager? Are you serious?

239
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,708
Of course I am.

240
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,791
Tell you what,
handle the Aguascalientes plant.

241
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,875
See if there are any parasites
we can exterminate!

242
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,958
You got it, Don Jaime. Excuse me.

243
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,125
What is it Lupita?

244
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,000
My father, again?

245
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,833
If he calls again,
tell him you couldn't find me.

246
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,208
Yeah, just tell him.
Tell the missus I'm on my way.

247
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,458
Fine, then. When she gets home. Bye.

248
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,083
Good day, sir.

249
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,875
We wanted to talk to you
about the layoffs.

250
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,875
Cirilo, I'm terribly sorry
but I have a meeting.

251
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,958
Let's talk some other time.
Sorry, excuse me.

252
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,500
Small town, new-money.

253
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,708
He won't forget us, though.

254
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,166
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

255
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,291
ASSHOLE

256
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,666
Jealous fuckers.

257
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,791
No wonder the country is going to shit.

258
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,958
Up yours!

259
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,416
PARADISE HILLS, MAKE YOUR
DREAMS COME TRUE!

260
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,250
- I'm home!
- Oh, Fran.

261
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,750
I'm so glad you're home,
I'm losing my mind.

262
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,375
- What happened?
- Your dad keeps calling.

263
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,708
And I'm fed up.

264
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,041
- Did he say what's it about?
- Something about your grandpa.

265
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,125
- He wants to tell you himself.
- New dress again, darling?

266
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,750
It's for Paloma's wedding.
Saks had a sale, I couldn't resist.

267
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,958
I got you a tie, and some Montblanc
gold cufflinks to die for.

268
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,750
- Do you like it? It's Dolce.
- I mean, it's very nice.

269
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,083
Please, you have to stop spending,
our credit cards are maxed out.

270
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,791
- I know, yes.
- Where are the kids?

271
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,500
Toni, Cati! Come say hi to your dad.

272
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,375
If the wife doesn't spend,
the husband won't prosper.

273
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,166
What's up, kiddos? How's it going?

274
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,083
Any news? Why haven't you changed?

275
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,708
I got an A in history!

276
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:15,000
Sister Idalia gave me
the role of Cinderella.

277
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,791
That's great to hear,
because I also have big news.

278
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,375
- What?
- No, no.

279
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,875
Go with Lupita and get changed for dinner.

280
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,125
- You got extra vacation days?
- Patience, MarÃ­a Elena.

281
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:31,416
Don Jaime congratulated me
and said if I keep it up,

282
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,333
and I learn English and Mandarin,
he'll make me general manager.

283
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,208
He might just make me partner.

284
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,666
- Does it come with a raise?
- Of course, at least double.

285
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,000
As much as that wimp of a manager makes.

286
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,416
Congratulations.

287
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,750
The truth is, we need a new SUV
and a better school for the kids.

288
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,875
One where they can meet
more affluent kids,

289
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,666
and learn English and French.

290
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,500
You know what else?
We should get a beach house.

291
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,833
- Don't you think?
- Yeah!

292
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,958
When you're the boss,
will you buy me a motorcycle?

293
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,583
- I want a pony like Paty's.
- Hang on.

294
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,833
Before you get too excited
and spend it all,

295
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,791
we need to pay off the mortgage first,

296
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,250
then we need to pay off the cars,

297
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,583
but more importantly, MarÃ­a Elena,

298
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,458
we have to pay off our loans
and the credit cards, right?

299
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,416
- What?
- Don't be a downer.

300
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,875
Honey, I'm not a downer,
I'm being realistic.

301
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,833
We can't just spend money
as if we were rich.

302
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,333
At least not until I get that promotion.

303
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,375
Excuse me.

304
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,500
Lupita, come here.

305
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,625
What is this slop?

306
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,333
What you told me to cook,
cheese and spinach "chuflÃ©."

307
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,166
More than a soufflÃ©, this looks like clay.

308
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,666
I told you to check with me
if you had any questions.

309
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,583
Yes, but you went "chopping"
so I did what I could.

310
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,791
Take this away and make us
some turkey sandwiches.

311
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,166
To teach you a lesson,
you're eating the whole thing.

312
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,958
- All right?
- Yes, ma'am, as you wish.

313
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,750
It's not enough she's filthy,
she doesn't know her place.

314
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,583
I don't know why you engage with the help.

315
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,000
Should I say you're not here?
I'm sure it's your father again.

316
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,916
I'll get it, Lupita.

317
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,458
My goodness, she thinks she's one of us.

318
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,000
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, son!</i>

319
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,125
How are you Dad?

320
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,500
<i>How's everything?</i>

321
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,375
Let me tell you, son.

322
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,916
Your grandfather Francisco,
may God rest his soul,

323
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,791
passed away a few days ago.

324
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,666
Grandpa Francisco died? How old was he?

325
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,500
- I'm so sorry.
<i>- We just did the math.</i>

326
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:42,625
<i>He was somewhere around 120,
but no one knows for sure.</i>

327
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,416
Give my love to Mom and Grandma Pascuala.

328
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,083
- Mari also sends her love.
<i>- I will, son.</i>

329
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:53,666
Listen, it's very important
that you come to Prosperidad.

330
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,541
<i>That's going to be a bit difficult.</i>

331
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,208
<i>I'm swamped with work.</i>

332
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,458
We don't really have
much of a choice here.

333
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,000
Pancho, look.

334
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,000
As part of your grandpa's
last will and testament,

335
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,875
he wanted you to attend his funeral.

336
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,833
And he ordered his attorney

337
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,375
<i>not to open his will
until you are present.</i>

338
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:19,666
<i>If you don't come home,
they might even kick us out of the house.</i>

339
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,375
Oh, man. That really sucks.

340
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,291
Listen, this really isn't
a good time for me.

341
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,166
Maybe I could try to visit
in December, how's that?

342
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,416
Come on, son. Don't do this to us.

343
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,041
Grandpa died days ago,
he's starting to stink.

344
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,833
<i>Don't you get it?
It's a case of life and death.</i>

345
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,458
What do you want me to say?
I can't do it, period.

346
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,625
Fine! If you can't, you can't!
What else is there to say?

347
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,166
I can't force you to come.

348
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,250
All right, give my love
to everyone back home!

349
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,375
Same here, Pancho! But let me tell you,

350
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:53,916
coming from you, I'm not surprised at all.
You've always been a lousy son.

351
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,375
<i>Selfish, ungrateful,
and a full-fledged bastard!</i>

352
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,708
Come on. Let's go, FilemÃ³n.

353
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,500
He hung up on me.

354
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,541
Oh, Fran.
You've never been close to your family.

355
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,041
- I'm surprised you're so upset.
- No, sweetheart.

356
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,458
My family is the worst,
but grandpa was different.

357
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,125
I was his favorite.

358
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:30,000
He helped me move away
and paid for my education.

359
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,375
Really? Maybe you should
visit your family after all.

360
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,041
- To claim your inheritance.
- What inheritance?

361
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,541
A plot of land somewhere?
A house in ruins?

362
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,791
Two donkeys and a cow?
There's nothing of value.

363
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,000
Maybe he left you the house.
I'm sure it's worth something.

364
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,000
I mean, sure.

365
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,833
But my parents and siblings
have always lived there,

366
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,083
So if I end up getting it,
I can't just kick them out.

367
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,916
I'd like to visit your hometown
to meet my grandparents.

368
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,750
I want a donkey and a cow to live with us!

369
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,000
- Aren't they sweet?
- Yeah.

370
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,875
I promise to take you
to Prosperidad one day,

371
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,250
so you can meet the family
and see where I grew up.

372
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,250
You'll see how beautiful the town is.

373
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,833
You know what, family?

374
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,375
We should go to bed, it's getting late.

375
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,041
- Shall we?
- Here are the sandwiches.

376
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,250
- Don't you want them?
- Thanks, have a good night.

377
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,375
Lupita, you can eat them or toss them out.

378
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,333
But eat the whole soufflÃ©,
see if you learn.

379
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,750
Good night.

380
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,875
Up yours!

381
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:38,416
<i>Do you profess or practice
the Catholic faith?</i>

382
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,250
<i>I'm a Christian...</i>

383
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,416
- Please, shut him off.
- Why, honey?

384
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,833
I'm sick of seeing him everywhere.

385
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,125
I hate his tropical accent,

386
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,666
and his endless speeches
about the noble masses,

387
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,916
and that the poor come first.

388
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,416
"Let's take from the rich
and give to the poor."

389
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,208
<i>...like the works of Jesus.</i>

390
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:02,666
<i>He was the most important
fighter for social justice.</i>

391
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,250
He's comparing himself to Jesus now!

392
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,708
The country is in shambles,
maybe he has a point.

393
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,791
Don't even joke about that.
Like my girlfriends say,

394
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:16,625
he's a populist demagogue
who'll ruin our country

395
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,541
and turn it into Cuba or Venezuela.

396
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,916
That's ridiculous. You know what?

397
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,666
You and Don Jaime should
chat about the President.

398
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,333
If you heard the stuff he says,
you'd idolize him.

399
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,875
I'm sure Don Jaime is right.

400
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,958
Good night, Lord Populist.

401
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,625
Good night, Lady Privilege.

402
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,500
Hey, Fran.

403
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:55,166
Are you absolutely sure
it's not worth finding out

404
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,125
what your grandfather left you?

405
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:00,000
Maybe he has something
you don't know about.

406
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:03,833
No, I'm absolutely sure it's not worth it.

407
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Good night, sleep well.

408
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,125
Night.

409
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,666
Pancho!

410
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:27,250
Pancho, come here!

411
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,375
Check out what I found.

412
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,583
Another one, Grandpa?

413
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,875
This one's huge! How many does this make?

414
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,791
Plenty, my boy. Plenty.

415
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:45,541
Don't forget this is a secret
just between you and me.

416
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:50,416
In the end, once I'm gone,
all this will be yours.

417
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,916
Of course, Grandpa. Don't worry.

418
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:59,625
Always remember that
it's full of vultures out there,

419
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02,750
just waiting around to steal from us!

420
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:07,125
You haven't said anything
to anyone, have you?

421
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,666
Nothing about the treasure?

422
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,458
How about my safe, Pancho?

423
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:15,583
I haven't told anyone! I swear to God.

424
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,083
I don't believe you, you lying brat.

425
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,833
I'm sure you told your parents
and your siblings.

426
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,541
I have to make sure
you keep your mouth shut,

427
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,416
Forever!

428
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,000
Fran!

429
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,875
You were having another nightmare.

430
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,166
We have to go to Prosperidad.

431
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We have to go to Prosperidad.

432
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:46,000
I want to ask for the chance
of taking three weeks off.

433
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,083
What do you mean, three weeks off?

434
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,625
Not even I take that much time off!

435
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,458
I'm not going on vacation, Don Jaime.

436
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:57,333
I have a very serious family situation,

437
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:00,375
and they need me in town
to handle some paperwork.

438
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,708
Pancho, you disappoint me.

439
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,625
I put so much trust on you
and you repay me with this?

440
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:10,458
Just because I'm fond of you,
I'll give you five days.

441
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:13,041
- No more.
- Thank you so much.

442
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,875
Rest assured,
I'll leave everything in order.

443
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:19,750
I'll be back before Thursday
to sign for the new machines.

444
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:22,291
Don't take your eye off the prize.

445
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,666
Thank you, sir.

446
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,500
Are we almost there, Daddy?

447
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:56,291
Princess, I already told you
we're three hours away.

448
00:25:56,375 --> 00:26:00,250
- Take another nap.
- Your hometown is so far!

449
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:04,666
We should've flown to Durango
and rented a car there.

450
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,416
Honey, I told you already.
Coming from Durango,

451
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,916
it's an eight-hour drive
across the mountain range.

452
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,250
Oh, really? How long has it been now?

453
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,208
We're getting closer, right, family?

454
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,958
Yeah.

455
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,000
Good.

456
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,041
Hey, Mom. Tell us the truth.

457
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,583
How come you haven't met Dad's family?

458
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,958
Don't ask me, ask him.

459
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:32,583
How come, Dad? Were you ashamed of them?

460
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,541
To tell you the truth,
I don't really know.

461
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:40,875
First, I finished college,
got a job at the plant,

462
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:43,541
then I met your mom, we got married,

463
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,125
and then you were born.

464
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:48,000
I guess we just kept putting it off.

465
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:51,333
The other day,
I heard Mom telling Aunt Jackie

466
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:55,416
that you never visited because
my grandparents are gross,

467
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,541
and they're always asking for money.

468
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:58,583
Catalina!

469
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:02,250
- Not cool.
- When did you last visit?

470
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,458
If memory serves, it's been 20 years

471
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,458
since the last time I visited Prosperidad.

472
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,791
Twenty years without seeing your parents?

473
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,000
That's almost twice my age.

474
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,666
- Holy shit.
- Toni!

475
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,208
I've told you over and over not to cuss.

476
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,291
Don't even think about cussing
in front of your grandparents.

477
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:23,083
Look at that, family.
We made it to the detour.

478
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:26,166
Great, does that mean we're almost there?

479
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,416
No, it's two more hours

480
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,416
- Take a nap.
- Listen to your parents.

481
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,208
Lupita, give Cati a pillow
and find the snacks.

482
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,166
Just don't leave crumbs everywhere.

483
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,833
Yes, Mom.

484
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,125
Check out this landscape. So beautiful.

485
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,291
Two hours of this?

486
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,625
- Can we roll up the windows?
- Good idea.

487
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:04,208
- Turn on the A/C.
- No, the dust will get in.

488
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,041
Does it remind you of your home, Lupita?

489
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:09,333
No way, sir.

490
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:13,000
San Pedro de los Saguaros
is much nicer, no offense.

491
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,541
It's so hot.

492
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,125
I'm roasting, jeez.

493
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,000
Oh, for fuck's sake.

494
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:24,541
We need to move that yuca.
Can you help me, Lupita?

495
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:25,916
Yes, sir.

496
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,791
- Let me get off, I'll help.
- Jesus!

497
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,750
- Kids, get out of the car.
- Okay.

498
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:37,458
- Grab that side, Lupita. We'll carry it.
- Sure.

499
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:41,625
- It's so heavy, sir.
- Hold on.

500
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,208
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

501
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,583
- Here we go.
- Fran.

502
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,625
What is it, honey? What?

503
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,500
Mom!

504
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:52,625
Howdy, friend. That yuca looks heavy.

505
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:55,125
Yeah, but we have it under control.

506
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,250
Lucky you.

507
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:01,541
This is a lonely road,
it gets pretty dangerous.

508
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,125
- Isn't that right?
- Stay put, miss.

509
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,541
Gentlemen, please. Let's all relax.

510
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,791
Here's my watch and my wallet.

511
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,666
You're welcome to take
anything from the car.

512
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,375
Any relation to the Reyes
from Prosperidad?

513
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:19,166
Yes, that's my family.

514
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,000
Fucking Pancho Reyes.

515
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,833
Don't you recognize me?

516
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:29,000
Filiberto R. Arriaga.

517
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,166
We were together in elementary school.

518
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,083
Beto? Didn't we use to call you Mapache?

519
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:41,000
Well, sorry about this.
A man's gotta make a living.

520
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,416
Yeah, I get it.

521
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:46,291
- You're here about your grandpa.
- Yes, such a tragedy.

522
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,250
My deepest condolences.

523
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:52,375
May God keep Don Francisco
in his holy glory.

524
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,125
Thank you, Beto.

525
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,833
Brother.

526
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:03,500
- Thanks.
- You staying in town?

527
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:06,500
Let's meet up for a drink and catch up.

528
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:10,125
- Sure, I'd love to.
- You have a nice family.

529
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,083
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, man.

530
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,541
- We'll clear the road for you.
- Thanks.

531
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,625
Sorry to scare you, miss!

532
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:20,291
Bye, kids! Welcome to Prosperidad!

533
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:23,083
- Thanks, Beto!
- Well, giddy up!

534
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,375
Come on.

535
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:26,583
Here we go.

536
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,083
See ya!

537
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:55,541
Look, children.
We've arrived in Prosperidad.

538
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:01,000
- How about a photo?
- Yes!

539
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:06,583
This can't be right. I don't have service!

540
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:09,583
My cell phone doesn't either,
and it's newer than yours.

541
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,458
Mine either, but listen.

542
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,708
I'm sure this is going to be
an unforgettable experience.

543
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,250
- Let's take a picture.
- Okay.

544
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:21,583
- Make it vertical.
- Let's do a boomerang.

545
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:22,875
All right.

546
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:26,833
Ready? One, two... Say cheese!

547
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,583
Cheese!

548
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,125
This isn't like you described.
It's a ghost town.

549
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:47,833
Must be the time of day.
I guess folks are napping.

550
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,750
See that place, honey?
That's Mapache's house.

551
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,250
- Don't remind me.
- Good morning!

552
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:57,416
- They don't seem too friendly.
- Hey, Dad?

553
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,041
Is this the whole town? Isn't it small?

554
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,333
And ugly.

555
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:03,750
Believe it or not,

556
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:07,291
Prosperidad was once
Mexico's wealthiest town.

557
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:12,000
The mountains had so much gold,
you could find it lying around.

558
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,333
Yeah, right.

559
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:17,041
All I see on the street
is trash and dog poop.

560
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,500
Look at the donkey.

561
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,333
Human poop?

562
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:24,625
- Don't look, kids!
- Children, please!

563
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:31,250
Wow, this is such a beautiful thing.

564
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,958
Check this out.

565
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:37,541
This is one of Prosperidad's
most beautiful traditions.

566
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:41,750
When someone dies, the family
parades them all over town,

567
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,916
to a beautiful, old song
called "Las Golondrinas."

568
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Judging by the coffin size,
they were kids, just like you.

569
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,083
Pancho!

570
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:54,000
- What?
- I said, shut up.

571
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,750
- They're here!
- They made it!

572
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,750
Let's go tell Grandpa!

573
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,125
Grandpa! Grandpa!

574
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:32,875
Grandma!

575
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:36,083
The rich relatives are here!

576
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,416
LA ESPERANZA MINE

577
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,875
They're here!

578
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,750
They're here!

579
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,625
They came!

580
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,625
Fran... What is this?

581
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,625
Pancho Francisco Reyes!

582
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,916
I'm so glad to see you, son!

583
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:09,750
My dear father!

584
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,625
I'm so glad you came,

585
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,750
because in a couple years
we might not be around.

586
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:19,208
- My beautiful mother.
- Praise the Lord!

587
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,583
Oh, son!

588
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,458
My Pancho.

589
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,708
Folks, meet my family.

590
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:28,000
This is my wife, Mari,

591
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,416
and these cuties are my children.

592
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,333
- Hello.
- Toni and Cati.

593
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,833
A white woman to boost the bloodline, son.

594
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:39,500
- Welcome to our home, ma'am.
- Thanks, Don Rosendo.

595
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,000
Nice to meet you, DoÃ±a Dolores.

596
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,083
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

597
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:49,291
Come on, Mariquita.
Meet the rest of the family.

598
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,541
Oh, Pancho!

599
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:56,041
This is my eldest son. Rosendo, after me.

600
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:59,750
Even though he's a big guy,
we all call him Rosendito.

601
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,583
What's going on, Rosendito?

602
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,333
You stink of manure.
Have you showered since I left?

603
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:09,875
Fucking Pancho, always running your mouth.

604
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,750
Have you been humping that cow?

605
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:14,708
Pervert.

606
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,791
This religious prude
is my daughter Socorro.

607
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,250
The Divine Providence
granted me the miracle

608
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,833
of seeing you again in this life, Pancho.

609
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,625
Socorrito, I see you didn't
become a nun after all.

610
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,666
This useless, lame, good-for-nothing,

611
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,958
who used to be the town teacher

612
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,500
and now thinks he's a poet,
is her husband Cruz.

613
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:41,958
Prosperidad's poet muse.

614
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:45,875
- Eyes serene, so clear!
- All right, enough.

615
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:50,791
This is my son, Hilario,
the artist in the family.

616
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:53,333
- Nice to meet you.
- And this girl...

617
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,875
- What was your name, again?
- PÃ¡nfila, Don Rosendo.

618
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:00,750
You forgot again? PÃ¡nfila LucÃ­a
Margarita PÃ©rez HernÃ¡ndez,

619
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:03,250
and now Reyes, at your humble service.

620
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,708
What's up, Hilario? How have you been?

621
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,000
You couldn't find anyone younger, fucker?

622
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:14,500
The perks of being the town's
most famous artist.

623
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:17,500
How are you, kiddo?

624
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:21,333
This gangster-looking boy
is my son, Rufino.

625
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,291
The black sheep of the family.

626
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:28,500
And this busty little minx
is his current girlfriend,

627
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:29,500
Gloria.

628
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,708
'Sup, lady.

629
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:34,916
Pleasure to meet you.

630
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,333
You're hotter than I thought, sis.

631
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,000
Thank you.

632
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:43,416
Rufino, look at yourself.
You look like a druglord.

633
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,458
Come on, Pancho. Life isn't fair.

634
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,166
We can't all be as lucky as you.

635
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,750
Here, we do what we can, not what we want.

636
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,375
Give me a hug, man!

637
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,500
- It's good to see you.
- Come here, bro.

638
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,541
Come on.

639
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:05,208
I'm Gloria LÃ³pez, but call me "Culichi."

640
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:08,125
- Pancho!
- Welcome back.

641
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:11,750
- At your service.
- Same here.

642
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,791
How should I explain this mess?

643
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:21,250
This lady used to be my son, Jacinto.

644
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,291
One day, to the family's
shame and dishonor,

645
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,250
she decided she wasn't a man
and became Jacinta.

646
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,083
Did I explain that right?

647
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:32,666
Nice to meet you, sis.
Sorry about Dad's nonsense.

648
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,750
Rosendo is your typical Mexican macho.

649
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,958
Oh, Pancho!

650
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:41,916
Look at how handsome you turned out!

651
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:46,708
I suppose you're surprised,
but it's not contagious.

652
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:50,250
Jacinto, I can't believe you've done this.

653
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,958
You were always weird, even as a kid.

654
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:56,166
Jacinta, even if it takes you
a second longer.

655
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,916
Hang on, meet my hubby.

656
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,500
- Lupe!
- Yeah.

657
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,541
- Nice to meet you.
- Guadalupe Flores, at your service.

658
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:08,416
- Good to meet you, ma'am.
- Nice to meet you.

659
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:11,875
And this one here is my daughter Bartola.

660
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,833
The only good one in the family.

661
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:17,625
Although, to be honest,
she's not too bright.

662
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:20,958
The idiot has six children
with six different men,

663
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:23,125
including a black one and an Asian one.

664
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:27,416
This latest one was a gringo
who didn't even speak Spanish,

665
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,916
but I guess you didn't do
much talking, huh?

666
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,583
Look at you! You were a baby when I left.

667
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,375
You're all grown up now!

668
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:39,958
So, which one of these is your husband?

669
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,291
- Oh, Pancho!
- What?

670
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:48,166
As soon as Billy found out I was pregnant,

671
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,958
he left without saying goodbye!

672
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,833
- Oh, sister.
- Anyway.

673
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:58,791
Those are Brayan, Yaroslavi,
Dudinka, Reagan,

674
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:02,250
and a bunch I don't know,
but they're all my grandkids.

675
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,166
All right, family, this goes to everyone.

676
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,666
This is Mari, my beloved wife,

677
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,000
and these are my kids, Toni and Cati.

678
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:14,541
- Hi, everyone.
- That's Lupita.

679
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:17,041
She helps around the house
and decided to join us.

680
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,375
Is she your servant?

681
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,958
Dad, that word is outdated.
She's a domestic worker.

682
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:26,750
- Are you banging her?
- Don't say such things, Dad!

683
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:31,791
Where's my hello, Panchito?

684
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:34,583
Have you forgotten about
your fucking grandma?

685
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,416
Ungrateful bastard!

686
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,291
Grandma Pascuala!

687
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:40,791
What a nice surprise!

688
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:44,666
Of course you're surprised,
you little shit.

689
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,416
You probably thought I was gone, right?

690
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,375
I wouldn't dare, Grandma!

691
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:53,708
Look, meet my family.

692
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,916
These are my wife and my children.

693
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,875
- Hi, there.
- Cute family, fucker.

694
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:05,875
You're so lucky your kids
came out looking white.

695
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:08,208
But you're still a bastard

696
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:11,166
for abandoning us all these years.

697
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,625
Come closer, yes.

698
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,791
I have a feeling they're not yours.

699
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,666
Pancho, why don't we take you
to your room?

700
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,791
You must be tired, let's go.

701
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,041
I'll see you later.
I'm glad you haven't changed.

702
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:32,375
- All right, your majesty.
- Come on.

703
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:36,000
I hope you and this woman wouldn't dare

704
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,583
to show up here empty-handed.

705
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,875
I hope you brought me
a nice gift, at least.

706
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,125
Yes.

707
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,875
Just a little something from all of us.

708
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:52,000
- They're Fendi.
- Nice save.

709
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,416
Now we're talking!

710
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,000
You look great, Mom.

711
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,666
- I know, right?
- Let's go.

712
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,375
Let's see your grandpa first,
so he knows you're here.

713
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:10,583
Come on, everyone!
We put him in this room.

714
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,458
Come right in.

715
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,458
Don't you think your mom
and sisters did a great job?

716
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,916
He's starting to smell,

717
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,458
but we had to honor his will
to have you at his funeral.

718
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:39,625
Now that you're here with your family,

719
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,833
the old man will finally rest in peace.

720
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,125
You'll have a chance to be alone with him,

721
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,416
and pray for him.

722
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,833
Give him a kiss, son!

723
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:11,125
Let's go to your room. Follow me.

724
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,041
Come on, son.

725
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,291
Don't! You will break it!

726
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:18,416
No! get out young man,
get out of the car please!

727
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,666
Come in.

728
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,208
Get out of here!

729
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:34,583
- Outside, quick!
- Get out!

730
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:38,875
We're putting you in Grandpa's room.
It's the best one in the house.

731
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:44,083
It's not a luxury hotel,
but we set it up with love.

732
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:46,208
The sheets are fresh from the laundry.

733
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:49,083
Here is some soap, a few towels,

734
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,041
and nice clean water
for you to freshen up.

735
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:55,000
- Do you like it, son?
- It's not bad for a couple nights.

736
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,416
Right, honey?

737
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,833
Don't worry about us.
Since you're both here,

738
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:06,000
we got you something, I hope you like it.

739
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,208
- What's this?
- It's a tie, HermÃ¨s.

740
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:13,000
A tie! Just what I needed!

741
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,375
Chanel No. 5, the classic.

742
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:19,041
If you don't like them,
Mari can exchange them.

743
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:22,708
No, Pancho, I can't.
Maybe you should've bought them yourself.

744
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,500
We'll let you get settled.

745
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:26,708
- Let's go.
- Thanks, Dad.

746
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:29,333
- What's that?
- Rest up, son.

747
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:32,125
- Mom, it's a leg.
- Great-grandpa's leg.

748
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,416
What?

749
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,041
Pancho!

750
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:38,875
- Have you seen...?
- Oh, I almost forgot!

751
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,833
Later today, we're having
a little welcome party,

752
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:44,000
to celebrate your homecoming.

753
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,833
Don't let us down.

754
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,875
We'll be there, Dad. Thank you.

755
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,708
- Come on, honey.
- All right.

756
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,583
You don't expect us to stay here, do you?

757
00:43:57,666 --> 00:44:01,958
Not only is this place filthy,
it's your dead grandpa's room!

758
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:04,375
That's his leg. This is a nightmare!

759
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:08,291
Should we book a room
in the village Hilton?

760
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:12,125
Didn't you hear they're
throwing us a party?

761
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:14,875
Sorry, but I can't insult
my family like that.

762
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:16,666
Yes, but this is a dump!

763
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,125
- It smells like poor people!
- Listen, MarÃ­a Elena.

764
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:24,625
I told you I came from a humble family,
and you always said you didn't mind.

765
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:28,166
Also, don't you forget I know exactly

766
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,875
how your white-trash parents
made their money.

767
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,541
So, please spare me
the aristocrat routine.

768
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:52,875
Come on, honey.
Don't be silly, stop crying.

769
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:57,916
Everything will be okay.
It's only a couple days, I promise.

770
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,500
Pancho, it's just...

771
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:03,125
I'm sorry for all that stuff
I said about your family,

772
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:06,833
but this is even worse
than my worst nightmare.

773
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,208
I need to tell you something
but don't get mad.

774
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,416
- What is it, champ?
- I need a bathroom.

775
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,208
- So do I.
- Number one, or two?

776
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:18,125
- Poop, maybe the squirts.
- Me too!

777
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:20,458
Hurry, come with me before it's too late.

778
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:22,291
- Run, run!
- Oh God, me too!

779
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:26,083
All right, kids.

780
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,583
Go that way, pick a tree,

781
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:32,125
pull your pants down,
and watch out for bugs.

782
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,916
I'll get you toilet paper. Hurry, guys.

783
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,666
- What, here?!
- Yes, here.

784
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,166
Pancho, are you telling me
there's no bathroom?

785
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,750
There's an outhouse,
but trust me, this is better.

786
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,750
Well, since I'm here.

787
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:52,041
- How you doing, kids?
- Fine!

788
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,458
Good.

789
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:30,250
Let's hear it, family!

790
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,250
Thanks, Dad!

791
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:07,416
Pancho, welcome again. Here's to you.

792
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,666
Thanks, Dad. Cheers.

793
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,041
Thank you for this party,
you went all-out.

794
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:14,583
Cheers!

795
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:18,833
You and your family deserve nothing less.

796
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:22,791
Really, we're all so happy
to have you here.

797
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,041
Hang on, Hilario! Wait a minute.

798
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:29,208
Hold it, guys.

799
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,791
Wait just a second,
I have a few words to say.

800
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:36,375
Kids, get over here!

801
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,208
Hey there, little guy!

802
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:48,875
My dear family.

803
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:56,250
This is a very special day
for your mother and me.

804
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,666
Seeing all of you together,
but especially,

805
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,625
having my son Pancho
and his family with us,

806
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,791
is more than I've ever dared to dream.

807
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,041
Please don't take this the wrong way,

808
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:11,166
but Pancho has always been my favorite,

809
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:15,041
and without a doubt the best of you lot.

810
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,125
Cheers, son. Cheers, Mariquita.

811
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:21,000
One more time, welcome to Prosperidad.

812
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:23,625
- Cheers, everyone!
- Cheers!

813
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:26,375
Say something, son! Don't be shy.

814
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:27,916
No way, no.

815
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,958
- Yeah, come on!
- Speech! Speech!

816
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:35,458
Do it, Dad!

817
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:44,291
First, I'd like to thank you
for your kind welcome.

818
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:46,666
After so many years,

819
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:50,916
my family and I are ecstatic
to be with all of you

820
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,791
right here in Prosperidad.

821
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,708
In order to keep this short,

822
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:00,500
let me tell you something from the heart.

823
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,333
This goes especially to mom and dad.

824
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:07,208
I hope you can forgive me
for not coming sooner,

825
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:09,625
and for abandoning you all this time.

826
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,208
I'm sorry.

827
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:14,333
- Cheers.
- Very nice, Pancho!

828
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:20,125
Still, we're only staying
for a couple of days.

829
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,083
We have to get back
to the capital soon, right?

830
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:24,208
- Yes, honey.
- Don't worry, son.

831
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:26,208
First thing tomorrow, we'll bury him.

832
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:29,625
Afterwards, we'll all get together
including your uncles,

833
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,625
and have the notary read the will.

834
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,083
Sounds great. Grandma Pascuala,

835
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:37,125
How are my uncles, Regino and Ambrosio?

836
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:39,250
I wish they were dead.

837
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:46,291
Unfortunately, those asswipes
are still a waste of oxygen.

838
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:49,625
I wish you would've invited them, Dad.

839
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:51,125
No way.

840
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:55,375
I'd rather die than let those pricks
set foot in this house.

841
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:56,541
Quiet, Rosendo!

842
00:49:56,625 --> 00:50:00,458
I'm not surprised to see Dolores,
the slut,

843
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:03,666
coming to the defense of her boyfriend.

844
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,416
Shut up, DoÃ±a Pascuala!

845
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,000
Always stirring the pot
with your lies, old hag!

846
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:12,666
Don't disrespect my mother!
What she said is true.

847
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:16,250
Everyone knows you were
whoring around with Regino.

848
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,875
Your mother's the whore,
you piece of shit!

849
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,166
Stop her! Come on!

850
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,000
Play something, boys!

851
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:38,291
It's your song, Mom!

852
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:17,541
Ready? One, two..!

853
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,791
- Come on, Cati!
- One, two, here we go!

854
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:23,000
Beat the shit out of this fucking gringo!

855
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:26,000
Teach him to respect us Mexicans, Cati!

856
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:29,083
- All right, ready?
- Come on!

857
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:40,625
Stop that, sis. Put that down.

858
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:43,000
Try this, I made it for you
with all my love.

859
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:46,125
- What is it, Rufino?
- It's called Nenepil NorteÃ±o.

860
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:49,375
You won't find a better one
anywhere but Prosperidad.

861
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:53,416
- Is it very spicy?
- If you don't like it, spit it out.

862
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,291
Forget about manners, we're all family.

863
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:58,375
What do you think?

864
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,125
- It's delish!
- Delish.

865
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:06,500
- What is it called?
- Nenepil NorteÃ±o.

866
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,541
Next, I'll make you one
with fried chitterlings.

867
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:12,791
I'll show you how the local meat
is nothing to frown upon.

868
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:15,000
But first, let me get you another tequila.

869
00:52:15,916 --> 00:52:18,291
Pancho, what's in Nenepil NorteÃ±o?

870
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,833
Don't ask, honey.

871
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:24,500
It's delish, I loved it. What's in it?

872
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,666
Fine, but I did warn you.

873
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:31,708
Nenepil is made
from the guts, liver, uterus,

874
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:34,541
and stomach of the pig, cooked in salsa.

875
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:36,500
It's a local delicacy.

876
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,333
- Delicious.
- Sis!

877
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:41,666
Another tequila? There you go!

878
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,291
- Pour me some.
- Do you have any lime?

879
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:45,666
Who wants tequila?

880
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:49,000
Cheers, boys! Take a quick break.

881
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,666
Don't be snotty! Come dance!

882
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,000
Come dance with us, it's a great song.

883
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,375
I'm not taking no for an answer.
Let's do this!

884
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,500
Bravo!

885
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,125
Let's take a family picture!

886
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:10,916
- Gather around.
- Wait, I'll go get Grandma.

887
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,708
Come with me, Mom. We're taking a picture.

888
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:17,166
I'm not doing that nonsense!

889
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,291
- Yes, you are.
- Come on, Grandma!

890
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,041
Fucking bullshit!

891
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:25,541
- Make room for Grandma.
- Don't push me around!

892
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:30,083
Say cheese on three. One, two, three.

893
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,041
Cheese!

894
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,958
Pancho, wait up!

895
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:37,041
Get in there, I'll take another one
so you're also in the picture.

896
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:39,333
- Thanks, bro. Make it vertical.
- Sister.

897
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,208
Say cheese on three.

898
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:45,541
- Cheese!
- On three, guys.

899
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:47,583
One... two...

900
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:16,958
I spy Rosendito and Lupita
kissing on a tree!

901
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:19,291
Get out of here, brats!

902
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,375
Go on, scram!

903
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,125
- Get out of here!
- Wait, don't...

904
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:38,750
The best thing I ever did
was leave this one-horse town,

905
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:40,416
and move to the capital.

906
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,708
Panchito, is it as nice as people say?

907
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:48,458
If we could get rid of
all the people there,

908
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:51,958
Mexico City would be
the nicest place in the world.

909
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:56,166
Would you take me there
and show me around?

910
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,333
- Well, I...
- Would you?

911
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:05,416
If we ever get a chance,
I'll show you anything.

912
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,791
Kids, it's time for bed. Go to your rooms.

913
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,166
No!

914
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,958
I'll go get the belt, then.
I'm not joking around.

915
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:22,625
Come on, quickly!

916
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:24,166
Go to sleep!

917
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:29,166
Night, Rosendito.

918
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:48,458
Why don't we take this
somewhere more private?

919
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:51,875
- I love a good secret.
- Me too! Let's go.

920
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,375
Good night.

921
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,333
Oh, come on.

922
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,958
- Here you go.
- Yes?

923
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,958
- One last drink.
- No.

924
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:04,208
What do you mean it's 15,000 pesos

925
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:07,166
for some pig meat and seasoned turkey?

926
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,166
You're kidding me, Don Pancracio!

927
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:12,333
Plus, one whole lamb,
nine pounds of Nenepil.

928
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:14,625
six pounds of cracklings,
ten pounds of guacamole.

929
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:18,750
Plus, a barrel of pulque,
twenty cases of beer,

930
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,458
and ten bottles of tequila.

931
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:23,291
Then, there's the tent,
the lights, and the chairs.

932
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:25,708
Give me a break, Don Rosendo!

933
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:30,041
Let me see if my children
can chip in, I'll be back.

934
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,125
Excuse me, Dad?

935
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:36,833
Can we add the boys' fee to the party tab?

936
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:41,250
- You said it was your treat!
- Only the first three songs.

937
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:44,208
We owe them for the rest.
See how angry they look?

938
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,291
It's only 7,000 pesos.

939
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:51,083
- I'll see what I can do.
- All right, Dad.

940
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,708
Come on, honey.

941
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:01,375
Look at these!

942
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:04,125
That's right. Get in there, just dive in.

943
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:09,500
Sorry to interrupt.

944
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:12,625
Can we talk with you for a moment?

945
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:15,875
Of course, Dad, certainly.
Good evening, ma'am.

946
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:17,333
All right, then.

947
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:23,375
- What's up, Dad?
- Son, we're sorry to ask,

948
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,500
but even after everyone chipped in,

949
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:29,250
we don't have enough to pay for the party.

950
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:31,208
Sure, no worries. How much?

951
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,833
Everything, including music,
comes to $25,000 pesos.

952
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:38,708
- How much do you have?
- After dipping into our savings,

953
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:41,000
we're still short almost by half.

954
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:44,250
Dad, that's pretty steep
for a house party.

955
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:45,750
Let me see.

956
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,166
I'll take this.

957
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,416
If there's anything left,
I'll bring it back to you.

958
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,833
Let's go, honey.

959
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:55,125
All right.

960
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,583
This is the last one, for real.

961
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,166
I have a question, sis.

962
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:10,791
Are those killer tits and ass
wholly natural,

963
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:12,375
or is that surgery?

964
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:18,625
My boobs, my ass, and my hair.

965
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,041
- Everything natural.
- I'd kill for that body.

966
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,541
- Same.
- Lupe!

967
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:26,166
My brother mentioned you were pretty,

968
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:28,541
but the bastard didn't say this much.

969
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:31,083
Hot damn! You're drop-dead gorgeous!

970
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,750
I'm going to bed.

971
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,833
- Come on, stay a while.
- Excuse me.

972
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:39,625
If she's leaving, let's call it a night.

973
00:59:40,625 --> 00:59:42,958
- I'm calling it a night.
- Party's over.

974
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,791
- You spilled my tequila!
- Stubborn old drunks.

975
00:59:56,125 --> 01:00:00,666
One more drink, a poem for everyone!

976
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:04,541
O Sweet Land!
Your surface is the gold of maize.

977
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:07,666
Your mines, the palace
of the King of Gold.

978
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:11,333
Herons gliding across the skies,

979
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:14,541
and the green flash of the parrots!

980
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:17,000
- And some other--
- Hey, you.

981
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:20,333
Tell your idiot husband
to shut the fuck up,

982
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:24,333
and find me some of that barbacoa meat.

983
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:28,000
- I want one more taquito.
- Sure, Grandma.

984
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:34,500
I keep thinking about
the way your parents talk.

985
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:38,375
And the fat mariachis!

986
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:41,750
And how your brother Rufino
wouldn't stop flirting with me.

987
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:46,291
Your sisters treat me
like the Princess of Monaco.

988
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:49,833
See? Not everyone is as lucky as we are.

989
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:53,000
Do you know who is the luckiest guy

990
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,666
in the whole wide world?

991
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:56,833
Who, honey?

992
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:08,875
- Do you want it?
- Yes, please.

993
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,666
Don't wake the kids, hurry up.

994
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,125
Move over.

995
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:16,916
- Here it comes.
- Hurry.

996
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,208
Keep it down.

997
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:22,625
- Pancho!
- What?

998
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:26,458
- Someone's spying on us!
- It's too dark outside.

999
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:28,333
Run!

1000
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:33,666
Sons of bitches.

1001
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,500
All these years and they haven't changed.

1002
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:40,041
Fuck you!

1003
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:45,625
What happened?

1004
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:48,041
Who was it? Oh, no!

1005
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,583
Relax, honey. It was only my nephews,
they didn't see much.

1006
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,583
- Oh, okay.
- Don't worry.

1007
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:55,333
Where were we?

1008
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:58,375
You were about to fuck me
with those muscles.

1009
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:00,541
- These muscles, sexy?
- Oh, yes!

1010
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:06,291
Oh, that's good.

1011
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,625
Keep it down, Pancho.

1012
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:14,000
Dad, can you tell me what's
"Moctezuma's revenge"?

1013
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:16,875
It's what happens to gringos
when they visit Mexico.

1014
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:18,916
- Why, champ?
- I know I'm not a gringo,

1015
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,875
- But I think I got it.
- Me too.

1016
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,500
Oh, man. Hurry up!

1017
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,458
Come on, hurry.

1018
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,916
I think I got it, too.

1019
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:51,458
We're going with Socorro if it's a girl.

1020
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,958
If it's a boy, Jacinto.

1021
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,625
What the hell?

1022
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,458
- Life's so unfair, man.
- Why?

1023
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:04,875
How is it that Pancho is doing so well,

1024
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:07,958
while we get fucked day in and day out?

1025
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,708
I wonder what Pancho's wife
thought about us.

1026
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:15,125
Easy. That we're lowlifes
without class or manners.

1027
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,791
And she'd be right, it's the truth.

1028
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:22,416
Judging by their SUV,
his watch, and those outfits,

1029
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,500
they're rolling in it.

1030
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,708
Imagine the palace they must live in.

1031
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:29,250
Did you see the jewelry
on that stuck-up bitch?

1032
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:32,791
Those earrings, that watch,
the necklace, the bracelet.

1033
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,333
I know these things,

1034
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:37,416
she was probably wearing
around $100,000 pesos.

1035
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,625
And her scent, Gloria. French perfume.

1036
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:45,416
Well, that doesn't make them
any less sinful or indecent.

1037
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:48,958
Tell me, Jacinto... Sorry, I meant Jacinta!

1038
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:53,041
How much is Pancho worth?
Just a ballpark guess.

1039
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:57,541
I don't know, but a lot.
Maybe a million dollars?

1040
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:01,250
Don't be stupid!

1041
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:03,458
If he had a million dollars,

1042
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:06,208
why would he come
to this town full of thieves?

1043
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:09,208
Who cares how loaded my brother is?

1044
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:13,833
It's up to us to make sure
we get some of it, right?

1045
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:17,833
- Cheers!
- Cheers to that, bro!

1046
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,791
Oh, look.

1047
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:33,666
Uncle Ambrosio!

1048
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:37,125
Good to see you, how are you?

1049
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:38,458
Fine, my son.

1050
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:41,958
Meet my wife, Mari, and my children.

1051
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,208
- Nice to meet you, my child.
- Likewise, Father Ambrosio.

1052
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:47,000
Cute children.

1053
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:50,375
- I hope they're baptized.
- Of course they are.

1054
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:53,375
In fact, Toni is getting ready
for his First Communion.

1055
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:55,208
- Right, champ?
- Yes, Dad!

1056
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,875
What a nice smile.

1057
01:04:57,958 --> 01:05:00,791
So you finally decided to come, Panchito.

1058
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:03,666
I'm glad, because if years of abandonment

1059
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,958
had doomed your soul to Purgatory,

1060
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:09,125
missing your grandpa's funeral
would be your ticket to Hell.

1061
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:13,250
How can you think that?
Grandpa always was like a father to me.

1062
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,333
Yeah, right.

1063
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:18,166
What brought you here to Prosperidad

1064
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,833
was greed for his will,
but we'll talk later.

1065
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:23,666
We better get on with the funeral,

1066
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:28,666
before the smell starts
attracting the buzzards.

1067
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,875
Shall we, pallbearer?

1068
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,458
- Pallbearer?
- What?

1069
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,250
- Good day, everyone.
- Good morning.

1070
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:39,583
Fucking sissy.

1071
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:48,000
Ready?

1072
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:51,250
May God take mercy on his soul.

1073
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:52,625
Let's go.

1074
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:13,041
The Lord has gathered us on this day

1075
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:15,250
to bid farewell to a great man.

1076
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:18,166
Our dear father and grandfather,
Don Francisco Reyes,

1077
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:21,625
is finally at peace
and has risen to Heaven

1078
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,833
to be with the Lord.

1079
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:28,708
Yet, his memory and example
shall live on in our hearts.

1080
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:33,000
A man of integrity, generous,
hard-working, and honest.

1081
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:36,833
A good husband, and a better
father and grandfather.

1082
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:40,375
May his legacy be a light to us all.

1083
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:43,708
- A beacon in our path--
- Listen up, Ambrosio.

1084
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:46,750
Cut the bullshit and get on with it.

1085
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:51,083
Your father was
a miserable son of a bitch.

1086
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:55,125
So, wrap it up already
because it's getting hot.

1087
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:57,333
I'm sorry, mother. Let us pray.

1088
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:11,875
For fuck's sake.

1089
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,625
Here comes the hurdle.

1090
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:18,541
The last thing we needed
was him and his tramp.

1091
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:22,833
- I'll give him a piece of my mind.
- Calm down, Rosendo!

1092
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,416
Francisco was his father, too.

1093
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,041
Don't make a scene at his funeral.

1094
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:30,583
Mommy!

1095
01:08:30,666 --> 01:08:33,083
- Godson.
- Hi, there.

1096
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:35,291
Excuse you.

1097
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,125
I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner.

1098
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:43,000
I can't tell you how upset I was
when I heard the news,

1099
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,041
or how much I've cried since then.

1100
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:47,875
Spare me your lies, you shameless bastard.

1101
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,666
Your father was sick for a long time,

1102
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,541
and he's been dead for three days,

1103
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:55,625
yet you never visited him
or paid your respects.

1104
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:58,416
Stop being a hypocrite.

1105
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,125
I need you, your floozy,
and that tumor you call a son

1106
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:05,000
to start praying like the rest of us,

1107
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:07,541
so we can be done with this bullshit,

1108
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:09,583
and we can get to the reading of the will.

1109
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:12,166
Yes, mother. My apologies, again.

1110
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:18,041
I'm so sorry. Really sorry, Granny.

1111
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:20,125
I was also very upset at Grandpa's death.

1112
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:23,125
Get out of my face, you hemorrhoid!

1113
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,875
Let us proceed.

1114
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:34,375
Good afternoon, everyone.

1115
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:35,833
Afternoon, counselor.

1116
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:40,250
In accordance with
Don Francisco's final wishes,

1117
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:44,833
I will commence reading his will.

1118
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:51,125
In the town of Prosperidad,
of the same municipality,

1119
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:56,125
Don Francisco Reyes Vargas
appears before me.

1120
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:59,625
He declares he is Mexican by birth,

1121
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:01,541
miner by trade,

1122
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:04,333
and a citizen of this municipality,

1123
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:10,083
where he was born
on the 21st of April, 1897.

1124
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:16,166
Being of sound mind and body,

1125
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:20,666
and expecting you've honored his last wish

1126
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:25,833
of having all his family present
for this solemn occasion,

1127
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:30,416
he manifests and declares
the following testament.

1128
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:35,083
To his great-grandchildren,
great-great-grandchildren,

1129
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:38,500
and further descendants,
whose name he doesn't know,

1130
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:43,500
he hereby bequeaths a 20-peso coin each,

1131
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,958
in the hope that, by investing it wisely,

1132
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:51,083
they will forge their own
path through life.

1133
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:53,375
Eat shit!

1134
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,166
Eat shit!

1135
01:10:59,916 --> 01:11:01,291
Everyone out!

1136
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,416
To his dear grandchildren,

1137
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,875
Rosendito,

1138
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,375
Hilario,

1139
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:10,791
Socorro,

1140
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,166
Rufino,

1141
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,375
Jacinto,

1142
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:16,041
or Jacinta, as she likes to be called,

1143
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:17,333
Reginito,

1144
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:18,625
and Bartola,

1145
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:22,791
he hereby passes on his donkey, his cow,

1146
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:26,250
his turkey, and his three pigs,

1147
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:29,750
so they can split them
however they see fit.

1148
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:33,500
To his daughter-in-law Dolores GarcÃ­a,

1149
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:38,666
in appreciation for one
memorable night of passion,

1150
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:44,041
he passes on his precious
Virgin of Guadalupe medal.

1151
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:47,375
To his son Ambrosio,

1152
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:52,250
who, as a good Christian,
and representative of God on Earth,

1153
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:55,500
attributes no value to material goods,

1154
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:58,333
he hereby leaves one Our Father,

1155
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:01,125
and three Hail Marys.

1156
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:02,541
Screw you, Dad.

1157
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:06,166
To his son Regino, who among his children

1158
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:09,791
was the only one
to lead a successful life,

1159
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:13,125
and realized his dream of becoming

1160
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:18,166
a thieving, corrupt,
bloodsucking politician,

1161
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:23,708
he leaves a second-hand, highlighted copy

1162
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:26,125
of the <i>Treatise on Morality,</i>

1163
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:29,250
like the ones the government
handed out in town.

1164
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:33,333
- Let's go.
- To his son Rosendo,

1165
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:36,958
who among the triplets

1166
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:39,708
was the only one
who followed his footsteps

1167
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:42,375
and took up mining,

1168
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:47,791
he passes on his pickaxe,
his shovel, and his cart,

1169
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:51,958
so he can keep pursuing
his ridiculous dream

1170
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:57,458
of finding a gold-bearing vein
in the old Esperanza mine.

1171
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:02,000
To his beloved companion
for so many years,

1172
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:05,208
DoÃ±a Pascuala Vargas GarcÃ­a,

1173
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:10,250
he passes on nothing less
than his deepest gratitude,

1174
01:13:10,333 --> 01:13:14,625
and wishes that her time in this world

1175
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:19,000
isn't prolonged for too long
so she can soon join him.

1176
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:23,083
Fucking Francisco Reyes!

1177
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:29,250
You were a fucking asshole
until the very end!

1178
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:34,208
I hope you rot in hell, you piece of shit!

1179
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:37,416
Say, Mr. Counselor.

1180
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:41,083
If he didn't leave anything to any of us,

1181
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,791
who the goddamn fuck is getting the house

1182
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:46,625
and all his belongings,
according to that asshole?

1183
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:51,500
Allow me, DoÃ±a Pascuala,
I haven't finished yet.

1184
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,083
Lastly,

1185
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:58,750
it his his will to appoint
as the universal heir

1186
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:00,541
to the rest of his assets,

1187
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:04,458
including the house,
the old Esperanza Mine,

1188
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,291
with all its tunnels and surrounding land,

1189
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:10,875
as well any movable
and immovable assets therein,

1190
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:14,000
as well as the items that
over the course of his life,

1191
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:17,125
he dutifully stored in his personal safe,

1192
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:22,583
of which yours truly is appointed
guardian, executor, and steward,

1193
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,708
to his grandson Francisco,

1194
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:28,666
who among his descendants was the only one

1195
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,083
whose hard work, effort, and dedication--

1196
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,833
What the fuck?!

1197
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:35,375
You'll have to excuse me, Mr. Counselor,

1198
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:38,083
but I don't believe a word you just read.

1199
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:42,208
Dad wouldn't have fucked us over
and left everything to Pancho!

1200
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:44,875
He hadn't heard from him
in over twenty years!

1201
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,208
I'm sorry, Don Rosendo!

1202
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:50,458
Those were Don Francisco's last wishes.

1203
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:52,500
Don't blame me,

1204
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:55,333
I'm just the messenger.

1205
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:00,916
Listen up, fuckers!

1206
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,708
Leave Mr. Toribio alone!

1207
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:09,333
Knowing that asshole Francisco,
I'm sure the will is true.

1208
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:11,666
He hated all of us!

1209
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:15,000
All we can do,

1210
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:18,916
is hope that Panchito takes pity on us

1211
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,375
and shares his inheritance
with the rest of us.

1212
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,958
- More beans, husband?
- No, Lola.

1213
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:44,375
I bet these welfare beans
from the government

1214
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:48,375
have weevils in them,
I always get so gassy.

1215
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:51,208
I'll take some, Mom.
I like those critters.

1216
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,583
- I want some too, Grandma.
- Sorry, that's all we had.

1217
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:59,958
Grandma gave away
all the leftovers last night.

1218
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:02,625
You didn't save anything
for Pancho and his family?

1219
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:05,125
You didn't invite them to eat with us?

1220
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:07,958
I did, but as soon as they got back,

1221
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:09,958
they went into their room
and haven't come out.

1222
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:12,833
What can we feed them?
Rancid welfare beans?

1223
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:14,541
Old tortillas?

1224
01:16:14,625 --> 01:16:17,875
Your daughter-in-law will have a fit!

1225
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:23,000
What if we slaughter a chicken or a pig?

1226
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:25,708
Are you crazy?! Those are my animals!

1227
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:28,500
I'm saving them
for my wife's 15th birthday.

1228
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,666
Curse this misery!

1229
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:33,291
How much worse can things get?

1230
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:36,000
For the millionth time,
don't be a crybaby.

1231
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,125
Act like a man!

1232
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:41,708
We've spent years eating
what we can, when we can,

1233
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:44,250
and you've never whined
like a little bitch.

1234
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:49,000
Sure, but I hoped that Dad
would leave us something

1235
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:50,958
that would turn our luck.

1236
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:54,583
You heard the counselor,
the old man had a safe!

1237
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:57,750
He's right, Grandma.
I heard him mention a safe.

1238
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,208
I heard it, too.

1239
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:03,708
I wonder what's in it.
Something valuable, for sure.

1240
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:06,541
Who the fuck cares what's in it?

1241
01:17:06,625 --> 01:17:09,416
Probably old documents, some photographs.

1242
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,250
Nothing of value,

1243
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:16,625
because I'm sure the old bastard
spent every last dime

1244
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:19,250
on whores and booze!

1245
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:23,041
I'll say it again.
How much worse can it get?

1246
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:24,833
May I?

1247
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:27,500
- Come on in, son!
- Excuse me.

1248
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:30,125
- Where are the kids?
- They're asleep.

1249
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:33,000
They got sunstroke after the procession.

1250
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:36,666
I'm sorry, son. There's no more food,

1251
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,916
but I can send Bartola
to fetch some tamales.

1252
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,583
Don't worry, Mom.
We're still full from the party.

1253
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:45,500
We don't feel so good. Right, Mari?

1254
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:46,666
Are you sure, son?

1255
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,833
DoÃ±a Pancha's green chili
tamales are the best!

1256
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:52,083
- And we have a tab.
- That's okay, Dad.

1257
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:56,791
All we came here to say
is that we had a long talk,

1258
01:17:56,875 --> 01:18:00,041
and we think we understand
how you must be feeling.

1259
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:03,750
We think Grandpa was unfair
in the way he split his assets.

1260
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:07,250
- More than unfair!
- Settle down. Settle down.

1261
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:11,166
Even though I got the house,
the mine, and the land,

1262
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:14,208
nothing will change for all of you.

1263
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,166
I told you, fuckers!

1264
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,750
Pancho is the best son in the world!

1265
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:24,916
Brayan, Dudinka!
Go and find Don Pancracio.

1266
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,708
Tell him to send us a pig
and tequila to celebrate!

1267
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:31,375
Hilario, go get your boys!
We'll need music!

1268
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:33,458
- Right away!
- Tell him I want lamb!

1269
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:36,375
Also some cracklings, but hold the hair.

1270
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:07,791
- Oh, my God.
- Fran, I don't feel good.

1271
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:09,750
It's just a hangover.

1272
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:14,291
Champ, be careful!

1273
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:24,125
Good morning!

1274
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:25,791
- Morning.
- Good morning, all.

1275
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:27,791
Morning, sleepyheads. Did you sleep well?

1276
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:28,958
More or less.

1277
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:32,916
- Where's Dad? And my brothers?
- They're running errands.

1278
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,458
They'll be back later to take you to town.

1279
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:39,375
I'm making you a nice breakfast
to cure your hangover.

1280
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,375
I'm sure it's a bad one.

1281
01:19:41,958 --> 01:19:44,208
I made some menudo, nice and spicy.

1282
01:19:44,291 --> 01:19:47,083
Also, some chilaquiles
in a three-chili salsa.

1283
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:51,208
I'm sorry, DoÃ±a Dolores.
I don't feel well, excuse me.

1284
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:54,708
Honey, eat something
to settle your stomach!

1285
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,750
Doesn't the madame like Mexican food?

1286
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,500
Snotty fart-smelling bitch.

1287
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:01,166
That's not it, Grandma.

1288
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:04,416
The food didn't agree with her,
she was up all night.

1289
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,458
Let's make her some tea
with epazote, jimsonweed--

1290
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:11,000
Mom, don't bother.

1291
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:12,750
- Morning, son!
- Hi, Dad.

1292
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:15,625
- Ready to go into town?
- I'm ready.

1293
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:20,750
Wait, son! Sorry to bother you,

1294
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:24,458
but can you lend me some money
to give to DoÃ±a Cata

1295
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:26,750
to pay for breakfast and today's lunch?

1296
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:32,916
Panchito. Can I get something
for my hemorrhoid cream,

1297
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,458
and for my cigarettes?

1298
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,083
Thank you!

1299
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,500
- I'll keep it safe for you.
- No.

1300
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:56,375
Son, pull over for a second.

1301
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:58,541
- Here?
- Yes, here. Come.

1302
01:21:09,416 --> 01:21:13,208
Look, son. All this is now yours.

1303
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:16,291
How far do the lands extend?

1304
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:17,583
- See the house?
- Yeah.

1305
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:20,416
The property line starts here
where the cross is,

1306
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,041
and it ends all the way
at the bottom of the mountains.

1307
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:28,916
How come you never grew crops,
or raised cattle to put it to some use?

1308
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,708
Son, clearly you've spent
too long in the city.

1309
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:35,041
All that grows here
is a few desert plants,

1310
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:37,000
some prickly plants, and bitterness.

1311
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:39,791
The only animals are
black snakes, spiders,

1312
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:42,291
and venomous scorpions,
isn't that right, Rosendito?

1313
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:45,333
If you and my brothers weren't so lazy,

1314
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:48,250
you would've used this land to get ahead.

1315
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:50,416
See? It's the same as when I left.

1316
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,708
No, Pancho.

1317
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:55,416
We haven't been lazying around.
Isn't that right, Rosendito?

1318
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,166
We work from sunrise to sundown every day.

1319
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,833
I can prove it.
We have a surprise for you.

1320
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:05,541
Remember the old mine?

1321
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:08,458
How could I forget the Refugio tunnel.

1322
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:11,750
I spent my entire childhood
helping Grandpa.

1323
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:15,541
He used to bring you out here
every Saturday.

1324
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:19,000
Well, you own it now.

1325
01:22:19,916 --> 01:22:22,750
We've been coming here every third day.

1326
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:27,041
We've been making surveys,
cleaning up, and drawing up plans.

1327
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:28,458
Open the gate, son.

1328
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:32,500
The thing is that, for the longest time,

1329
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,833
Grandpa Francisco, Rosendito, and myself,

1330
01:22:35,916 --> 01:22:38,333
we've been making plans
to open it up again.

1331
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:40,458
Believe it or not,

1332
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:44,250
I'm sure that behind those rocks,

1333
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:47,750
hides the world's largest
gold-bearing vein.

1334
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:50,375
- Right, Rosendito?
- You said it, Pops!

1335
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:52,791
Dad, forget about those old dreams.

1336
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:55,541
According to Grandpa,
who knew more than anyone,

1337
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:58,041
the gold in this mine
was emptied years ago.

1338
01:22:58,125 --> 01:22:59,833
No way, son!

1339
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:02,375
Even the fucking gringos and the Canadians

1340
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:05,208
have been coming around to check it out.

1341
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:08,208
Like a bunch of blond-haired vultures!

1342
01:23:08,708 --> 01:23:11,500
What are you talking about? Listen.

1343
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:15,875
As far back as I can remember,
you've clung to this fantasy.

1344
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:20,166
And, look! Twenty years later, and your
laziness has kept everything the same.

1345
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:24,291
I needed a partner
and money to get it going!

1346
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:27,250
But now that you're rich and came back,

1347
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:29,000
We can finally do it!

1348
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:31,791
Listen to me, Dad. Don't take this wrong,

1349
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:34,291
but I'm only back in town
for a couple days

1350
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:36,583
to see about the will
and attend the funeral,

1351
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:40,583
so I better hurry along
if I want to sort everything out.

1352
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:42,958
Why don't we get to town
so I can sort things out

1353
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:45,041
with the counselor and my godfather?

1354
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:46,833
- What do you say?
- Sure, son.

1355
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:49,708
Promise me you'll think about the mine.

1356
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:54,083
I swear we could make
billions off of this!

1357
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:57,583
All right, then.
I promise to think about it.

1358
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:59,083
Come on, let's go.

1359
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:01,625
Come on, Rosendito! Get a move on!

1360
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:12,875
BIENESTAR BANK

1361
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,791
Wish me luck, Dad.
I'll see you at the cantina.

1362
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:34,208
- I'll tell you how it went.
- All right, son.

1363
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:36,541
Don't let that asshole Regino
push you around.

1364
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:39,458
He sure loves his bribes
and backroom deals.

1365
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:42,333
Be careful, brother.
Keep an eye on your wallet.

1366
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,375
- See you later.
- All right.

1367
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:13,625
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1368
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:16,666
- I'm looking for Mayor Reyes.
- Through there.

1369
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:17,750
Thanks.

1370
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:20,375
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1371
01:25:22,166 --> 01:25:25,083
Good day, I'd like to see
Don Regino Reyes.

1372
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:28,375
- Is he expecting you?
- Unfortunately, no.

1373
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:31,250
I'm his nephew, I was hoping he'd see me.

1374
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:35,625
Are you the mayor's relative,
the one from the capital?

1375
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:39,125
The one who got
Don Francisco's inheritance?

1376
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:41,083
Francisco Reyes, at your service.

1377
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:44,250
News sure seem to spread
like wildfire in this town.

1378
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:45,708
Oh, sir.

1379
01:25:46,291 --> 01:25:49,458
I'm sorry, but the mayor
is a very busy man.

1380
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:53,750
Still, seeing as it's you,
I'll ask Commander Reyes.

1381
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:57,750
- He's in charge of his schedule.
- I really appreciate it.

1382
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:16,166
Thank you so much.

1383
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:19,750
What's up, Reginito?
Don't you remember me?

1384
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:21,625
I'm your cousin Pancho!

1385
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:24,541
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to talk yesterday.

1386
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:28,583
What's up, Pancho? Did you only
come back for the inheritance?

1387
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:30,458
Don't be silly, that's not the reason.

1388
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:34,458
Reginito, do you think
I can see my godfather?

1389
01:26:34,541 --> 01:26:38,708
First of all, don't call me Reginito.
It's Commander Reyes, got it?

1390
01:26:38,791 --> 01:26:42,250
Sorry, but the mayor can't see you
without an appointment.

1391
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:46,000
I understand, Commander.
Can you tell him I'm here?

1392
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:48,291
I just want to check
the paperwork for the house.

1393
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:49,541
No can do.

1394
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:53,500
I'll check his schedule
to pencil you in for next week.

1395
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:56,625
Meanwhile, take a seat.
I have a lot of work to do.

1396
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:02,041
Thanks a lot.

1397
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:06,916
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

1398
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:11,750
Take this to pass the time.
It's going to be a long wait.

1399
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:17,083
Thanks, doll. I appreciate
your help with those gringos.

1400
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:20,291
I'll drop by later tonight
for another English lesson.

1401
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:21,625
Bye, honey.

1402
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:25,916
My dearest godson! I'm so glad to see you.

1403
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,458
Same here, godfather.

1404
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:32,958
- Why were you sitting there?
- I was hoping to see you.

1405
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:36,125
- How's the town treating you?
- Just fine.

1406
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:39,291
You know how things work in Prosperidad.

1407
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:42,166
Did this asshole tell you
you couldn't come in?

1408
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,250
No, not at all.

1409
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:47,375
I'm in a bit of a rush,
I only have a couple days

1410
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:49,458
to sort out the house and the inheritance.

1411
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:51,958
Listen up, Reginito!
Get this through your head.

1412
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:56,333
Pancho here is like a son to me,
and he's free to walk in, got it?

1413
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,750
Of course, Dad!

1414
01:27:58,541 --> 01:28:01,333
I've told you over an over
not to call me Dad here.

1415
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:05,041
You'll get me accused of nepotism.
Get lost, check what's out there.

1416
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:08,625
Make sure no one bothers me
so I can talk to my godson.

1417
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:11,166
- Come on in.
- Later, Commander.

1418
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:13,833
Couldn't be more corrupt!

1419
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:18,291
They only admit gringos
and rich guys with connections.

1420
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:21,833
- Have a seat, Godson.
- Thanks.

1421
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:28,208
What have you been up to all this time?

1422
01:28:28,291 --> 01:28:33,333
Well, things were rocky for a bit
when I first got to Mexico City.

1423
01:28:33,416 --> 01:28:36,375
You know how shitty
those city folks can be.

1424
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:38,958
They treated me like garbage.

1425
01:28:39,041 --> 01:28:42,125
Things started to turn around
once I graduated,

1426
01:28:42,208 --> 01:28:44,291
found myself a job, and got married.

1427
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:46,458
I have two wonderful kids.

1428
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:49,625
So, now I'm here, back in Prosperidad.

1429
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:54,708
I see that you switched political parties.

1430
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:58,541
Oh, son. Times have changed.

1431
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:01,833
PRI no longer serves this country.

1432
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:05,291
The party was ruined
by corruption and impunity.

1433
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:07,291
Then I tried PAN,
but it was the same thing,

1434
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:10,208
except they're also
God-fearing hypocrites.

1435
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,791
And today, at the hands of our President,

1436
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:15,416
the country is undergoing
its fourth transformation.

1437
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,000
Things are better than ever!

1438
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:21,958
And he's magically put an end
to corruption and impunity.

1439
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:26,458
Now, I guess you're here and very happy,

1440
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:29,416
because of your grandfather's inheritance.

1441
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,375
Honestly, besides coming to visit you,

1442
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:35,750
I was hoping you could help with
the paperwork for the house,

1443
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:37,916
and to get in touch
with the notary to get my stuff.

1444
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,041
Don't worry about all that,
I'll gladly help you.

1445
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:42,500
- Thank you so much.
- However,

1446
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:46,541
before you can take possession
and put everything in your name,

1447
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:49,041
you need to be up to date
with all the property's expenses,

1448
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:52,750
settle the mortgage,
and any outstanding utility bills.

1449
01:29:52,833 --> 01:29:55,375
How much are we talking about?

1450
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,291
That doesn't include interest
or late-payment fees.

1451
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:05,500
Your family hasn't paid bills
or property tax for years.

1452
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,958
What? Is it too much?

1453
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:11,375
I'm not sure the house and land
are even worth this much.

1454
01:30:12,166 --> 01:30:15,000
Is there any way
we can come to an arrangement?

1455
01:30:15,083 --> 01:30:17,041
Francisco, damn it!

1456
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:20,750
I just told you the President
put an end to corruption!

1457
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:23,000
Check this out. Educate yourself.

1458
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:26,875
Plus, you can drop the act.
I can tell you're rich.

1459
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:32,000
Anyway, you've always known
you're my favorite nephew.

1460
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:35,666
That's why I'm going to help you.

1461
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:38,375
Really, Godfather? How?

1462
01:30:38,916 --> 01:30:41,666
- I'll give you two options.
- Lay 'em on me.

1463
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:45,416
First option, you settle the debt
in a single payment,

1464
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,333
and I'll waive the interest
and the surcharges.

1465
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:50,041
What's the second one?

1466
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:52,541
- Sell me the property.
- What, all of it?

1467
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:55,583
- The house, the mine, the land?
- All of it.

1468
01:30:56,166 --> 01:30:58,416
Where would that leave
my parents and siblings?

1469
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:02,916
Of course, I would let them
keep living in the house,

1470
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,041
at least until my mother passes away.

1471
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:09,500
After that, those parasites
you call your family

1472
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:11,708
will have to figure it out on their own.

1473
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:15,833
Forgive me, Godfather,
but I can't do that to them.

1474
01:31:15,916 --> 01:31:19,708
Think it over, son.
That's all I can do to help.

1475
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:23,291
I'm very interested
in buying that property.

1476
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:25,125
Let me think about it.

1477
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:27,750
With all due respect, you're putting me
in a very awkward position.

1478
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:32,541
You got it. Don't take too long though,
the interest is increasing.

1479
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:35,250
You'll have to excuse me,
but as you can see,

1480
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,166
the country needs me
and the noble masses await.

1481
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:39,083
Sure.

1482
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:03,875
Look at this dress! Isn't it pretty?

1483
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:05,833
Do you think she'll mind if I keep it?

1484
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:08,666
She won't even notice, she has so many!

1485
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,708
Look, Mom!

1486
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:13,583
This the good stuff, the madame's jewels!

1487
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:16,583
Enough, thieving bitches!
Put everything back!

1488
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:19,125
Put that watch down!
How dare you steal from me!

1489
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:23,541
- And you, fucking lowborn!
- Screw you, cunt!

1490
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:26,041
What did you call me?

1491
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:29,458
I'll teach you not to take
what doesn't belong to you!

1492
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:34,625
THE EAGLE AND THE SNAKE CANTINA

1493
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:40,041
- Cheers, buddy.
- Cheers!

1494
01:32:40,916 --> 01:32:43,916
CÃ¡stulo, get us a bottle
and beer for everyone!

1495
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,916
My son Pancho is treating us!

1496
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,458
- Hey, you.
- Sit with us, son.

1497
01:32:47,541 --> 01:32:51,125
Are you paying their tab?
It's over 3,000 pesos already.

1498
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:54,250
- It's fine.
- Come on, bring a chair.

1499
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:57,083
Look, my friends.
This is my son Francisco,

1500
01:32:57,166 --> 01:32:58,750
the one I've been telling you about.

1501
01:32:58,833 --> 01:33:01,708
The best and brightest
of the Reyes family.

1502
01:33:01,791 --> 01:33:04,041
- Thanks. Hello.
- Remember him?

1503
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:07,375
Sure, we met earlier at Regino's office.

1504
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:08,541
Right, that was you.

1505
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:11,541
I didn't know it was Pancho. Welcome back.

1506
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:14,166
So, how did it go with that bastard?

1507
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,791
I'm not sure.

1508
01:33:15,875 --> 01:33:19,000
It turns out that the property
is in a lot of debt,

1509
01:33:19,083 --> 01:33:21,791
and I can't take possession
until the debt is paid.

1510
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:24,291
That's the typical bullshit
from that asshole Regino!

1511
01:33:24,375 --> 01:33:27,166
You should've paid it all to shut him up.

1512
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:28,875
That's the thing, Dad.

1513
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:31,666
You haven't paid a dime in so many years--

1514
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:33,416
Never mind that, son. We'll talk later.

1515
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:37,333
I was just telling my buddies
you're going to lend me

1516
01:33:37,416 --> 01:33:40,375
the money to reopen
the old Esperanza mine.

1517
01:33:40,458 --> 01:33:43,500
I heard him say it. I swear to God.

1518
01:33:43,583 --> 01:33:45,041
Congrats, Panchito.

1519
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:48,750
I hope you can finally make
your dad's dream come true.

1520
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,541
Honestly, Don Rosendo,

1521
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:53,916
you're lucky to have such a great son.

1522
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,583
Not only good, buddy. He's rich as hell!

1523
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:02,000
And without a doubt,
the best of my children.

1524
01:34:03,791 --> 01:34:06,750
Gathered around an old cantina table,

1525
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:12,625
we find six to eight men,
like a group of hippies!

1526
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:14,833
Here we go!

1527
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:22,541
Come on, son. Tip your brother-in-law.

1528
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:24,750
Also, pay the boys to sing us a few songs.

1529
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:26,791
Fine, Dad.

1530
01:34:27,833 --> 01:34:29,125
Cheers, gentlemen!

1531
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:42,125
Stupid Pancho!

1532
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,458
There's no service.

1533
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,375
Screw this town.

1534
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:50,958
Screw those bitches from hell!

1535
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:56,000
You bitches don't know
who you're messing with!

1536
01:34:56,750 --> 01:35:01,291
Wait till you see what hot chicks
are in my son-in-law's whorehouse.

1537
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:05,708
- Hello, Florcita.
- Hi, there.

1538
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:09,250
- Where's my son-in-law and the missus?
- They're upstairs.

1539
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:12,583
I'll add the girls to your tab.
You can square up with the boss.

1540
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:13,916
All right.

1541
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,250
Come on, sweetheart. I'm feeling romantic.

1542
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:19,291
Listen up, girls.

1543
01:35:19,833 --> 01:35:22,083
I want you to take care of my son Pancho.

1544
01:35:22,166 --> 01:35:23,541
Show him a good time.

1545
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:27,375
Catrina, make sure he's happy
because he's paying for this.

1546
01:35:27,458 --> 01:35:29,416
- Isn't that right, son?
- Sure, Dad.

1547
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,250
Why hello, Panchito.

1548
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:34,583
Which one of us tickles your fancy?

1549
01:35:34,666 --> 01:35:36,875
Or would you prefer a mÃ©nage Ã  trois?

1550
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:40,750
Don't worry, ladies.
I'll just wait for those two.

1551
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:43,875
Have a seat, I'll treat you
to some tequila while we wait.

1552
01:35:43,958 --> 01:35:47,166
Oh, Panchito! such a party pooper.

1553
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:49,875
It's like you're not one of the Reyes.

1554
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:51,708
Yes, thankfully.

1555
01:35:51,791 --> 01:35:53,291
Have a seat.

1556
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:55,458
Manuela, bring some beer!

1557
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,500
Stop crying, baby.

1558
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:03,666
Those big, beautiful eyes
are going to get puffy.

1559
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:07,166
I assure you that my girl
meant nothing by it.

1560
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:11,333
No one had ever called me
something so awful, Rufino.

1561
01:36:11,916 --> 01:36:14,666
Besides, Pancho left early this morning,

1562
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:18,750
and I think he's forgotten all about us.

1563
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:21,958
Come on, now. Have some more tequila.

1564
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:25,625
Drink this, and look, forget about Pancho.

1565
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:29,000
He probably ran into an ex
and is having some fun.

1566
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:32,583
You think Pancho is capable
of cheating on me, Rufino?

1567
01:36:32,666 --> 01:36:33,541
Jeez.

1568
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:38,250
I don't know if my bro is still a player,

1569
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:40,166
but when he was young,

1570
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:44,041
that son of a bitch slept
with every single girl in town.

1571
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:47,083
Oh, no!

1572
01:36:54,125 --> 01:36:55,875
Hey, hey.

1573
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,708
None of them were as beautiful as you.

1574
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,833
None of them had such pretty eyes.

1575
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:03,000
- What?
- Yeah.

1576
01:37:04,125 --> 01:37:08,000
- Or such a smoking body.
- Do you mean it, Rufino?

1577
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:10,666
Do you really think I'm beautiful?

1578
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:13,375
Like an angel.

1579
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,583
Not like an angel.

1580
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:19,875
You're more beautiful
than the Virgin Mary.

1581
01:37:22,833 --> 01:37:24,208
Oh, Rufino.

1582
01:37:26,625 --> 01:37:30,458
Sure, I can get you a job
at a strip club in the city.

1583
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:32,458
It's a classy joint.

1584
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:34,125
Fucking Jacinta!

1585
01:37:34,625 --> 01:37:38,208
I told you, clients can't leave
without paying first!

1586
01:37:38,291 --> 01:37:40,458
Stop hitting me, Lupe!

1587
01:37:40,541 --> 01:37:44,083
He said he was taking a leak,
but he climbed out the window.

1588
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:46,125
I'm not buying it!

1589
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:50,291
You're a common slut who flirts
with every guy who walks in!

1590
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:51,500
Take this!

1591
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:54,416
- You bitch!
- Are you okay, bro?

1592
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,250
You listen to me, Lupe.

1593
01:37:58,333 --> 01:38:00,833
That's no way of treating
my brother, back off!

1594
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:02,541
Is that so?

1595
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:05,916
Turns out the little lord
has some balls after all!

1596
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,125
I can throw a punch.

1597
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:10,041
Come at me, then!

1598
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:14,000
I thought you had balls!
Let's see if you can dance.

1599
01:38:14,083 --> 01:38:17,666
Enough, Guadalupe! Don't be such a beast.

1600
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:23,250
Pancho is going to think
we're a bunch of animals.

1601
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:27,041
Look, why don't I get you
a nice shot of tequila,

1602
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:30,875
so you can settle down
and drink with old friends?

1603
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:32,958
- How's that?
- All right.

1604
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:37,625
- Thanks, bro.
- Sorry about that.

1605
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:43,083
If I'm not tough on them,
the business is fucked.

1606
01:38:43,166 --> 01:38:45,625
No worries, Lupe. No big deal.

1607
01:38:46,541 --> 01:38:48,000
- Cheers, then.
- Cheers.

1608
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:49,416
Cheers bro.

1609
01:38:51,291 --> 01:38:52,583
Enough about this.

1610
01:38:54,791 --> 01:38:58,291
But listen to me, though.
Just so we're good,

1611
01:38:58,791 --> 01:39:01,916
I think you should pay
for the drinks and the girls.

1612
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,250
Yes, of course.

1613
01:39:06,916 --> 01:39:09,000
What's up, son? Everything good?

1614
01:39:09,083 --> 01:39:11,458
- You having fun?
- Sure thing, Dad.

1615
01:39:15,041 --> 01:39:16,750
Now it's a party!

1616
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:53,458
That's good, son.

1617
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:59,083
Shit, hold on!

1618
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:14,083
Come on, son.

1619
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:17,083
Let's ask your mother
to make us some dinner.

1620
01:40:17,166 --> 01:40:19,666
- We'll sleep better.
- I'll catch up.

1621
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:22,625
First, I have to check on
Mari and the kids.

1622
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:26,125
I've told you to act like a man,
don't be such a wuss.

1623
01:40:26,208 --> 01:40:30,625
- That's how you spoil a woman.
- I'll be right there.

1624
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:32,958
- I'll see you in a sec!
- All right, Pancho.

1625
01:40:40,916 --> 01:40:43,208
- Who is it?
- Who else, my love?

1626
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:45,166
It's me, Pancho. Your husband.

1627
01:40:45,916 --> 01:40:48,208
- Open up, MarÃ­a Elena.
- I'm coming.

1628
01:40:50,791 --> 01:40:54,500
- Pancho!
- What's with that stick?

1629
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:59,541
We have to leave this place.
I had the worst day.

1630
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:02,083
I hate your family more each day.

1631
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:04,375
Honey, what's wrong?

1632
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:09,375
Your mom poisoned me with some tea
and I was passed out all day.

1633
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:14,000
Then, the women came in
to steal what they could.

1634
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:17,833
They touched all my stuff
and I was so angry

1635
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:20,541
that I got in a fight
with that slut Gloria!

1636
01:41:20,625 --> 01:41:22,791
- What do you--?
- Pancho!

1637
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:27,916
There's something else
I don't want the kids to hear.

1638
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,916
- Oh, Pancho...
- What is it?

1639
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Your brother Rufino came into our room

1640
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:35,708
and tried to force himself on me.

1641
01:41:35,791 --> 01:41:39,458
Honey, honey. You're drinking too much.

1642
01:41:39,541 --> 01:41:42,958
I think it's the booze
because hear me out.

1643
01:41:43,041 --> 01:41:44,875
My family might not have the best manners,

1644
01:41:44,958 --> 01:41:48,125
but stealing, poisoning,
and seducing you by force?

1645
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:50,083
I'm sorry, but that's not who they are.

1646
01:41:50,166 --> 01:41:52,000
You're wrong, Dad! Mom is right.

1647
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:55,041
Our cousins stole and broke our iPads.

1648
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:59,875
It's true! Those rude kids
cut my doll's head off.

1649
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:00,916
Look!

1650
01:42:01,708 --> 01:42:04,416
They tore up my teddy bear!

1651
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:07,083
Oh, my goodness.

1652
01:42:07,166 --> 01:42:11,791
I'll have a serious talk with them.
This is completely unacceptable.

1653
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:15,791
My family is sick of you. They're scared.

1654
01:42:16,333 --> 01:42:20,625
No one here would ever hurt your family!

1655
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:25,083
We're so happy you're here!
Isn't that right, everyone?

1656
01:42:25,166 --> 01:42:27,375
- Yes, of course.
- So happy.

1657
01:42:27,458 --> 01:42:30,250
I have to believe Mari and my kids.

1658
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:33,083
It's probably a culture clash.

1659
01:42:33,166 --> 01:42:36,416
Your wife and children
are rich and spoiled,

1660
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,083
they're not used to our country ways!

1661
01:42:39,166 --> 01:42:41,833
I'm sorry to be blunt,

1662
01:42:41,916 --> 01:42:44,666
but your wife has
a serious drinking problem.

1663
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:47,666
- She's drinking like a fish!
- Wait, Mom.

1664
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:49,875
I've been married to her for 15 years!

1665
01:42:49,958 --> 01:42:52,416
In all that time, she's never been drunk.

1666
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:56,208
Let me be clear, as soon as
I sort things out with the notary,

1667
01:42:56,291 --> 01:42:59,583
hopefully tomorrow, I'm going back
to the city! Do you hear me?

1668
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:03,833
Mr. Panchito, this is so hard for me,

1669
01:43:03,916 --> 01:43:07,500
but before you go back,
I need to ask you a favor.

1670
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:10,041
- What is it?
- See, Hilario and I,

1671
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:14,000
we want you and Mrs. Mari
to be the godparents to our kid.

1672
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:15,666
Are you crazy, PÃ¡nfila?

1673
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:18,583
If anything, Panchito will be
the godfather to my twins.

1674
01:43:18,666 --> 01:43:21,416
Both of you are fucking delusional.

1675
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,208
I spoke with Uncle Ambrosio
and reserved the church,

1676
01:43:25,291 --> 01:43:27,875
so that Pancho can baptize my kids.

1677
01:43:27,958 --> 01:43:31,000
Quiet, you shrews!
Don't talk to my wife like that!

1678
01:43:31,083 --> 01:43:33,750
Besides, Pancho agreed
to produce my album.

1679
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:36,583
Can you buy me a few cows first?

1680
01:43:36,666 --> 01:43:41,041
Screw that! Lupe and I need money
to hire more girls for the brothel.

1681
01:43:41,125 --> 01:43:43,916
- Pancho promised already.
- Over my dead body!

1682
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,458
He's lending us the money
for a truck and a real gun.

1683
01:43:47,541 --> 01:43:49,458
- Put that down!
- It's fake!

1684
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:53,791
For fuck's sake!

1685
01:43:54,791 --> 01:43:58,166
If you can't be civil about this,
you can all fuck off.

1686
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:59,125
Thanks, Dad.

1687
01:43:59,208 --> 01:44:02,541
You're acting like vultures,
circling a carcass.

1688
01:44:02,625 --> 01:44:06,708
Pancho is only helping me
to open the old mine back up.

1689
01:44:06,791 --> 01:44:09,291
- He already promised, didn't you, son?
- What did you say, Dad?

1690
01:44:09,375 --> 01:44:13,375
Fucking Panchito!
Don't be a fucking moron.

1691
01:44:13,458 --> 01:44:16,000
Tell everyone to fuck off.

1692
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:20,875
If you were any smarter,
you'd leave this very night.

1693
01:44:20,958 --> 01:44:24,166
If you don't, before you know it,

1694
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:26,625
this sorry group of bloodsucking pests

1695
01:44:26,708 --> 01:44:30,541
will take the fucking clothes
right off your back!

1696
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:34,500
- Ignore her, she has dementia.
- Grandma Pascuala is right.

1697
01:44:34,583 --> 01:44:37,125
I made a huge mistake coming back here.

1698
01:44:37,208 --> 01:44:39,333
I'm leaving! I'm fucking leaving!

1699
01:44:44,375 --> 01:44:46,208
I told you, fuckers.

1700
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,375
I hope we didn't kill the goose
that lays the golden eggs.

1701
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:26,125
- We're finally home.
- Thank God, Fran.

1702
01:45:26,208 --> 01:45:29,541
I thought we'd never leave
that goddamned town.

1703
01:45:29,625 --> 01:45:32,875
I hear you, honey. We're never going back,

1704
01:45:32,958 --> 01:45:36,416
and we'll never have to see
my dreadful family again.

1705
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:09,583
Surprise!

1706
01:46:10,416 --> 01:46:13,541
What's up, Pancho? What took you so long?

1707
01:46:13,625 --> 01:46:16,416
I hope you don't mind, but we felt like

1708
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,333
making a nice lunch
to welcome you, sit down.

1709
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:21,666
Praise the Lord you got home safe!

1710
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:23,416
You see, Panchito?

1711
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:28,666
I told you you'd never
get rid of us, fucker!

1712
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:53,375
- Fran? Fran!
- No! What?

1713
01:46:53,458 --> 01:46:57,500
Wake up! There's a police car outside.
I'm too afraid to go out.

1714
01:46:57,583 --> 01:46:59,583
- Go see what they want.
- All right.

1715
01:46:59,666 --> 01:47:01,208
Oh, my goodness.

1716
01:47:13,458 --> 01:47:15,833
What's going on?
What's all this fuss about?

1717
01:47:15,916 --> 01:47:19,000
Sorry to bother you so late, but...

1718
01:47:19,083 --> 01:47:23,083
- We really need your help!
- What happened?

1719
01:47:23,166 --> 01:47:27,583
They caught that idiot Rufino
selling drugs in the square,

1720
01:47:27,666 --> 01:47:30,708
and your cousin Reginito
wants to put him in jail.

1721
01:47:30,791 --> 01:47:33,916
Panchito, the trouble is
this is his sixth offense.

1722
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,750
That orangutan wants
to take him to a federal prison.

1723
01:47:36,833 --> 01:47:40,083
If he does, no amount of gold
will be enough to get him out.

1724
01:47:40,166 --> 01:47:43,875
Let me talk to Reginito.
Give me a fucking break.

1725
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:45,916
God bless you, son!

1726
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,333
God bless you!

1727
01:47:49,166 --> 01:47:50,708
I'll be right back, honey.

1728
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:53,375
You're such a good man, bro.

1729
01:47:55,375 --> 01:47:58,250
He's a hard-working man,
what's the charge?

1730
01:47:58,333 --> 01:47:59,791
Evening, Commander.

1731
01:48:00,583 --> 01:48:02,000
What's up, Pancho?

1732
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:05,041
Did your parents tell you
what your brother did?

1733
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:07,625
Yes, they did. That's why I'm here.

1734
01:48:07,708 --> 01:48:10,333
Is there any way we can
get all this cleared up?

1735
01:48:10,416 --> 01:48:14,416
Look, Pancho. Your brother's been charged
with very serious crimes.

1736
01:48:15,625 --> 01:48:18,958
I can't cut him loose
for less than ten grand.

1737
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:22,541
Brother! My soul brother!
You're such a good man,

1738
01:48:22,625 --> 01:48:26,208
pay him what he wants,
I promise to pay you back.

1739
01:48:27,958 --> 01:48:31,500
I only have three grand,
so it's up to you.

1740
01:48:32,708 --> 01:48:35,583
- Take it or leave it.
- Damn it, Pancho.

1741
01:48:36,083 --> 01:48:39,750
You take advantage of me
because we're relatives.

1742
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:41,583
Fine, let him out.

1743
01:48:47,458 --> 01:48:48,750
Thank you, bro.

1744
01:48:50,166 --> 01:48:53,208
Seriously, thank you.
You're an angel, man.

1745
01:48:53,291 --> 01:48:57,125
I promise to pay you back.
I'll give you double! Double!

1746
01:48:57,208 --> 01:48:58,458
Come on, boys!

1747
01:48:58,958 --> 01:49:01,750
{\an8}MUNICIPAL POLICE

1748
01:49:10,291 --> 01:49:13,041
Morning, sleepyhead. Why so late, huh?

1749
01:49:13,125 --> 01:49:14,750
What do you mean?

1750
01:49:14,833 --> 01:49:17,625
It was you guys who didn't let me sleep.

1751
01:49:17,708 --> 01:49:19,750
Let me make you some breakfast.

1752
01:49:19,833 --> 01:49:22,083
Huevos rancheros? Chilaquiles?

1753
01:49:22,166 --> 01:49:25,708
I don't want anything.
Tell this to the others,

1754
01:49:25,791 --> 01:49:29,500
I ask nothing of you,
so you ask nothing of me.

1755
01:49:29,583 --> 01:49:32,041
Once I settle the papers with the notary,

1756
01:49:32,125 --> 01:49:34,666
I'm leaving forever, did you hear me?

1757
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:43,625
Morning, son!

1758
01:49:46,708 --> 01:49:48,458
What's gotten into him?

1759
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,625
I bet it's something he ate.

1760
01:49:53,625 --> 01:49:56,083
I have an idea to cheer him up.

1761
01:49:56,166 --> 01:49:57,375
Follow me, son.

1762
01:50:01,416 --> 01:50:02,333
Damn it.

1763
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:04,750
Sorry, bro! I'm so embarrassed.

1764
01:50:05,666 --> 01:50:08,958
- I didn't know you were here.
- Don't worry, I'm almost done.

1765
01:50:10,166 --> 01:50:11,458
So, listen.

1766
01:50:11,541 --> 01:50:14,958
We're so very grateful
for what you did last night.

1767
01:50:15,541 --> 01:50:18,458
Rufino and I would like
to show you our gratitude.

1768
01:50:19,041 --> 01:50:22,250
Don't worry, with some luck,
he'll pay me back one day.

1769
01:50:22,666 --> 01:50:23,958
Why wait?

1770
01:50:24,791 --> 01:50:26,958
Rufino sent me to give you an advance.

1771
01:50:27,041 --> 01:50:29,458
- Oh, my God.
- You like?

1772
01:50:29,541 --> 01:50:32,708
Well, fuck it. It's the only payment
I'm going to get.

1773
01:50:32,791 --> 01:50:34,000
Come here.

1774
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:41,000
- Come on, do it!
- Hold on.

1775
01:50:41,083 --> 01:50:42,125
Hurry.

1776
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,958
Yes, yes!

1777
01:50:47,041 --> 01:50:50,375
Just like that! Give it to me.

1778
01:51:07,375 --> 01:51:09,125
What is it, honey?

1779
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:13,791
Can't you go to him?
We've been waiting all day.

1780
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:16,125
Go where, exactly?

1781
01:51:16,208 --> 01:51:18,875
It's going to get dark,
and the roads aren't safe.

1782
01:51:18,958 --> 01:51:21,250
Remember your friend Mapache and his men?

1783
01:51:22,208 --> 01:51:23,791
- I'll be waiting.
- Okay.

1784
01:51:28,708 --> 01:51:31,500
There he is! That's him pulling in.

1785
01:51:32,625 --> 01:51:36,125
Kids, get your things.
Help me with the luggage, Lupita.

1786
01:51:42,291 --> 01:51:44,333
The safe is here!

1787
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:50,000
- Lupita...
- What's that?

1788
01:51:57,458 --> 01:51:59,458
Afternoon, Mr. Reyes.

1789
01:51:59,541 --> 01:52:02,375
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm glad you finally made it.

1790
01:52:02,458 --> 01:52:04,250
Sorry about the delay.

1791
01:52:04,333 --> 01:52:09,375
To be straight, it's not easy
to move this monstrosity.

1792
01:52:09,458 --> 01:52:10,833
I see that, it's huge.

1793
01:52:10,916 --> 01:52:14,208
- Can I see some ID?
- Of course.

1794
01:52:15,458 --> 01:52:16,541
Let's see here.

1795
01:52:17,083 --> 01:52:19,791
- Here, it's all in order.
- Thank you.

1796
01:52:19,875 --> 01:52:24,958
Aside from the safe,
I'm going to deliver the deed,

1797
01:52:25,041 --> 01:52:27,875
as well as a letter
Don Francisco left you.

1798
01:52:27,958 --> 01:52:33,000
- Is there somewhere we can sit?
- You can take the dining room.

1799
01:52:33,083 --> 01:52:34,833
No thanks, Dad. We need privacy.

1800
01:52:34,916 --> 01:52:37,833
- This way, sir.
- Boys, unload the safe!

1801
01:52:37,916 --> 01:52:41,041
Have them take the safe
into our room, honey.

1802
01:52:41,125 --> 01:52:43,458
It's too big for the car,
but we'll figure it out.

1803
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:45,750
- Yeah, okay.
- Follow me, sir.

1804
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:48,375
Gentlemen? Follow me, please.

1805
01:52:48,875 --> 01:52:50,541
This way, thanks.

1806
01:52:51,416 --> 01:52:52,916
Kids, move.

1807
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,625
Rufino, Hilario, Rosendo!
Let's give them a hand.

1808
01:52:57,208 --> 01:52:59,916
What do you think is in that big safe?

1809
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,791
I have no idea, honey, but I won't go
to my grave without finding out.

1810
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:08,458
Get out of the way, Cruz!
You're not helping!

1811
01:53:08,541 --> 01:53:11,791
Maybe we can strap it
to the roof of the car?

1812
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:14,958
- The roof would collapse.
- Here it comes, guys!

1813
01:53:15,041 --> 01:53:18,250
- How will we take it home?
- Careful with the boards!

1814
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:19,833
It's barely on the edge.

1815
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,541
There you go.

1816
01:53:32,333 --> 01:53:34,375
Come on, Rosendo!

1817
01:53:37,625 --> 01:53:40,541
- Thanks, boys.
- May I borrow your pen? Thanks.

1818
01:53:44,375 --> 01:53:46,541
- Here's the full file.
- Thanks.

1819
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:48,958
- Your grandfather's letter.
- I appreciate it.

1820
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,000
- Your pen.
- Right.

1821
01:53:51,083 --> 01:53:54,458
I hope you don't mind a piece of advice.

1822
01:53:54,541 --> 01:53:57,958
In my experience,
it's best that you protect yourself.

1823
01:53:58,041 --> 01:54:00,916
If you only knew half the stuff I've seen,

1824
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,666
or what some families can do
over an inheritance,

1825
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:07,458
- you'd take note of my advice.
- Thanks, counselor.

1826
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:08,666
I'll leave you to it.

1827
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:11,500
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Go ahead.

1828
01:54:11,583 --> 01:54:13,750
- Please!
- Clear the way.

1829
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:16,791
Lupita, would you mind giving us a moment?

1830
01:54:16,875 --> 01:54:19,000
- Need a hand, bro?
- No, thanks.

1831
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:21,333
- Wait, Pancho!
- Step back, thank you.

1832
01:54:21,416 --> 01:54:22,625
Give us a moment.

1833
01:54:23,583 --> 01:54:25,125
They're such pests!

1834
01:54:25,875 --> 01:54:28,958
Kids, close the windows.
Make sure no one sees.

1835
01:54:29,041 --> 01:54:30,083
Yes, Dad!

1836
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:38,000
- Watch out, kids.
- Sure, Dad.

1837
01:54:40,208 --> 01:54:43,125
"Dear Pancho, if you're reading this,

1838
01:54:43,208 --> 01:54:45,958
I'm probably dead and burning up in Hell."

1839
01:54:46,041 --> 01:54:50,166
"If that bastard BuendÃ­a
followed my instructions,

1840
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:52,666
you know my whole estate is now yours."

1841
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:55,791
"At this time, you must be
standing before the safe."

1842
01:54:55,875 --> 01:54:58,125
"Here are the instructions
to crack it open."

1843
01:54:58,208 --> 01:55:00,333
"Follow them exactly and prepare yourself

1844
01:55:00,416 --> 01:55:02,958
for what you are about to find."

1845
01:55:04,125 --> 01:55:05,166
Will you help me?

1846
01:55:07,833 --> 01:55:09,833
"Left, 42."

1847
01:55:10,625 --> 01:55:13,125
"Right, 84."

1848
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:15,083
"Left, 10."

1849
01:55:15,166 --> 01:55:16,375
Left, 10.

1850
01:55:16,458 --> 01:55:17,958
"Right, 31."

1851
01:55:29,625 --> 01:55:30,958
Nothing but trash.

1852
01:55:32,708 --> 01:55:35,250
That's trash. Grandpa's leg.

1853
01:55:35,333 --> 01:55:36,958
- Oh, God.
- It stinks.

1854
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:39,291
Dirty old man.

1855
01:55:40,708 --> 01:55:42,125
Give me that.

1856
01:55:45,458 --> 01:55:47,125
That's trash.

1857
01:55:48,625 --> 01:55:49,791
Grandpa's gun.

1858
01:55:51,333 --> 01:55:54,250
How many did he kill?
We should keep it safe.

1859
01:55:55,833 --> 01:55:57,291
I'll take that.

1860
01:55:58,791 --> 01:56:01,625
- Check it out! Some wristwatches...
- Wristwatches!

1861
01:56:01,708 --> 01:56:04,833
...and his old medals,
we could sell all these.

1862
01:56:08,333 --> 01:56:09,625
Hear that, Mari?

1863
01:56:14,333 --> 01:56:15,791
Fucking Grandpa.

1864
01:56:16,458 --> 01:56:19,458
I knew he had something,
but I never expected this.

1865
01:56:19,541 --> 01:56:21,250
Mari... Mari!

1866
01:56:27,833 --> 01:56:28,958
Pancho!

1867
01:56:30,708 --> 01:56:32,041
It's beautiful!

1868
01:56:34,375 --> 01:56:35,750
Fucking Grandpa!

1869
01:56:39,916 --> 01:56:41,916
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen!

1870
01:56:44,833 --> 01:56:46,375
How much is this worth?

1871
01:56:46,458 --> 01:56:49,000
The coins alone are worth
some twenty million pesos,

1872
01:56:49,083 --> 01:56:51,541
and the ingots probably 1.5 million each.

1873
01:56:51,625 --> 01:56:52,750
Mari, we're rich!

1874
01:56:52,833 --> 01:56:56,375
Not rich, Pancho. We're millionaires!

1875
01:56:58,333 --> 01:57:01,833
We can pay our debt
and buy a house, a car.

1876
01:57:01,916 --> 01:57:04,916
- We can change our lives.
- Not only that, honey.

1877
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,500
We can finally change our social status!

1878
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,458
Honey! What are they doing?

1879
01:57:23,416 --> 01:57:26,583
They're freaking out,
the safe was full of gold!

1880
01:57:27,166 --> 01:57:29,625
They're putting it back in the safe.

1881
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:34,625
- Are we rich, Dad?
- Yes, son! We're rich!

1882
01:57:37,041 --> 01:57:39,291
Try to get a count on the ingots.

1883
01:57:39,791 --> 01:57:41,625
Twenty or so.

1884
01:57:41,708 --> 01:57:44,833
Plus, a bunch of nuggets,
maybe two pounds each.

1885
01:57:44,916 --> 01:57:47,208
Also, coins! Lots and lots of coins.

1886
01:57:47,291 --> 01:57:50,250
Are there enough coins
for every one of us?

1887
01:57:50,333 --> 01:57:52,708
Most definitely. Enough to go around!

1888
01:57:52,791 --> 01:57:54,458
"Anyway, dear Pancho,

1889
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:57,208
I bid you farewell, wishing you the best

1890
01:57:57,291 --> 01:58:01,416
and hoping you continue
honoring the Reyes name."

1891
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,625
"With all my love, Grandpa Francisco."

1892
01:58:03,708 --> 01:58:07,458
"P.S. As a token of love and appreciation,

1893
01:58:07,541 --> 01:58:10,541
I hope you build me a bigger
and better mausoleum

1894
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:13,458
than the one they built
for Benito JuÃ¡rez."

1895
01:58:13,541 --> 01:58:16,458
"Be careful with your relatives."

1896
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:20,541
Put it all in the safe.
I'll go talk to them.

1897
01:58:21,083 --> 01:58:23,541
Pancho's coming! Act natural.

1898
01:58:23,625 --> 01:58:26,041
Wait for him to tell us the news himself.

1899
01:58:26,125 --> 01:58:28,500
Hurry up, kids. Everyone sit down.

1900
01:58:36,125 --> 01:58:37,583
Is that everyone?

1901
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,208
What's going on?

1902
01:58:47,916 --> 01:58:50,208
Why do you look so serious?

1903
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:53,625
It's nothing, son. We were just talking.

1904
01:58:53,708 --> 01:58:58,000
We're all broken up about
how we've been acting,

1905
01:58:58,083 --> 01:59:01,458
so we wanted to apologize
before you leave.

1906
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:03,166
- Right, guys?
- Yes.

1907
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:05,791
- You're family.
- I'm so sorry, Pancho.

1908
01:59:05,875 --> 01:59:10,083
Don't worry, Dad.
Time and distance will heal this wound.

1909
01:59:10,166 --> 01:59:14,500
So, we're definitely leaving.
Tomorrow before dawn.

1910
01:59:14,583 --> 01:59:19,000
Son, stay a few more days.
I promise we won't bother you.

1911
01:59:19,083 --> 01:59:21,583
I'm really sorry, Mom.
I've made up my mind.

1912
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:24,708
Believe me, I deeply regret
how everything turned out.

1913
01:59:24,791 --> 01:59:29,125
Mari and the kids send their love,
and thank you for your hospitality.

1914
01:59:29,708 --> 01:59:32,666
From the bottom of my heart,
thanks for everything.

1915
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:35,083
Thank you, and best regards.

1916
01:59:35,166 --> 01:59:37,791
- Uh, son...
- Hey, Panchito!

1917
01:59:37,875 --> 01:59:41,375
Just so I don't take
the curiosity to my grave,

1918
01:59:41,458 --> 01:59:46,875
what did you find inside
your grandpa's safe?

1919
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,458
Just as you guessed, Grandma.

1920
01:59:49,541 --> 01:59:52,625
Old letters, photographs,

1921
01:59:52,708 --> 01:59:55,125
underpants, a brassiere,
and a few trinkets.

1922
01:59:55,208 --> 02:00:00,000
Don't worry, I'll leave it open
so you can go through it.

1923
02:00:00,083 --> 02:00:03,500
Sounds good, dear.

1924
02:00:03,583 --> 02:00:06,916
- Safe travels.
- Thanks, Grandma.

1925
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,750
- God bless, son.
- Bye!

1926
02:00:09,833 --> 02:00:12,958
- Bye, kids!
- Bye!

1927
02:00:13,458 --> 02:00:16,375
That two-faced snake!

1928
02:00:17,166 --> 02:00:20,750
Just as petty and miserable
as his grandfather!

1929
02:00:25,208 --> 02:00:27,291
All right, fuckers. So, what?

1930
02:00:27,375 --> 02:00:31,791
Are we just going to sit here
while Pancho takes our gold?

1931
02:00:31,875 --> 02:00:33,125
No!

1932
02:00:33,208 --> 02:00:37,208
In that case, let's show him
what the Reyes are made of!

1933
02:00:37,291 --> 02:00:39,000
- Yeah!
- That's right!

1934
02:00:40,875 --> 02:00:42,250
Mr. Pancho!

1935
02:00:42,333 --> 02:00:44,000
Mr. Pancho, come quick!

1936
02:00:44,083 --> 02:00:46,500
Your car is burning!

1937
02:00:46,583 --> 02:00:48,583
Hurry up, sir!

1938
02:00:49,375 --> 02:00:51,666
I'm coming! I'm coming!

1939
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:54,458
- What's going on?
- Your car's on fire!

1940
02:00:54,541 --> 02:00:56,916
I don't know what happened!

1941
02:00:58,250 --> 02:01:00,375
The car! Pancho!

1942
02:01:00,458 --> 02:01:02,250
Kids, stay with me.

1943
02:01:05,125 --> 02:01:07,750
- Lupita, did you see anything?
- No, sir.

1944
02:01:07,833 --> 02:01:12,125
I was asleep in the barn.
The animals just went crazy.

1945
02:01:12,208 --> 02:01:15,666
I started smelling smoke,
so I went outside

1946
02:01:15,750 --> 02:01:20,291
and I saw your car going up in flames.
That's when I ran to tell you.

1947
02:01:20,375 --> 02:01:23,333
Are you lying to me? Look me in the eye!

1948
02:01:23,416 --> 02:01:25,875
I swear I'm not lying!

1949
02:01:27,125 --> 02:01:28,916
Motherfuckers!

1950
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:33,375
They'll be sorry for this!
I'll put them all in jail!

1951
02:01:33,458 --> 02:01:36,083
Mari, check over there.
I'll check the house.

1952
02:01:36,166 --> 02:01:38,583
- Selfish fucks!
- For fuck's sake!

1953
02:01:39,541 --> 02:01:41,166
Get out here! Where are you?

1954
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:43,458
Jealous bums!

1955
02:01:47,916 --> 02:01:49,375
- Fuck this shit!
- There's no one here.

1956
02:01:49,458 --> 02:01:51,250
They're gone!

1957
02:01:51,333 --> 02:01:53,916
Those bastard are hiding,
they're up to something.

1958
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,666
- Honey, come with me.
- Okay.

1959
02:01:56,750 --> 02:02:00,750
Lupita, stay here. If you see
anything strange, come get me, quick!

1960
02:02:00,875 --> 02:02:02,416
- Fucking run!
- Yes!

1961
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,958
I'll be right back, sweeties.
Don't be afraid.

1962
02:02:05,041 --> 02:02:07,458
- Hurry, let's go!
- Be careful, sir.

1963
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,916
Burning his car was a great idea.

1964
02:02:16,125 --> 02:02:18,250
Here's what I'm thinking.

1965
02:02:18,791 --> 02:02:20,791
Why don't we kidnap Pancho's children,

1966
02:02:20,875 --> 02:02:22,916
and demand the treasure as ransom?

1967
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,666
- I could look after the kids.
- Don't be stupid, Ambrosio!

1968
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:30,125
If we kidnap my grandkids,
they'll know it was us.

1969
02:02:30,208 --> 02:02:33,416
We came to you because
you know your Bible,

1970
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:36,166
and that thing is full of fucked-up ideas!

1971
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:38,541
We could poison them like Saint Elisha

1972
02:02:38,625 --> 02:02:40,541
poisoned his sons by the River Jordan.

1973
02:02:40,625 --> 02:02:43,333
Or rake them over the coals
like Saint Lawrence.

1974
02:02:43,916 --> 02:02:47,458
What if we ask Regino?
He might have ideas.

1975
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:51,750
Are you crazy, Lola?
If Regino finds out about the treasure,

1976
02:02:51,833 --> 02:02:54,041
he'll find some way
to keep it all to himself.

1977
02:02:54,125 --> 02:02:57,125
No matter what we decide,
we have to do it today.

1978
02:02:57,208 --> 02:03:01,166
With that fortune, Pancho can buy
himself a hundred new cars!

1979
02:03:08,833 --> 02:03:12,291
Fran, how are we taking this
back to Mexico City?

1980
02:03:12,375 --> 02:03:15,416
Not only does it weigh a ton,

1981
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:18,375
we can't get on a bus
and risk this fortune.

1982
02:03:18,458 --> 02:03:21,083
Please, honey. We're not taking a bus.

1983
02:03:21,166 --> 02:03:24,708
We have to hide the treasure
from those vultures.

1984
02:03:24,791 --> 02:03:27,125
- Okay, and then?
- Tomorrow,

1985
02:03:27,208 --> 02:03:30,250
we'll go into town, buy a new truck,

1986
02:03:30,916 --> 02:03:34,875
retrieve the gold, and go back home.

1987
02:03:34,958 --> 02:03:38,500
But, where can we hide it
without anyone seeing?

1988
02:03:38,583 --> 02:03:39,833
Mari...

1989
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:42,458
Mari, I have a plan.

1990
02:03:43,583 --> 02:03:46,125
I'm going to take this, just to be safe.

1991
02:03:47,333 --> 02:03:51,083
I feel sorry for any of my piece-of-shit
relatives if they try something.

1992
02:03:51,666 --> 02:03:53,708
Like Grandpa Francisco would've said,

1993
02:03:54,291 --> 02:03:56,458
I'll put a bullet through their skulls.

1994
02:04:04,916 --> 02:04:05,833
All right, let's go.

1995
02:04:05,916 --> 02:04:07,375
- Lupita.
- Yes?

1996
02:04:07,458 --> 02:04:10,375
Keep the door locked
until we return, got it?

1997
02:04:10,458 --> 02:04:12,416
- Yes, sir.
- Be good, kids.

1998
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:14,375
Listen to Lupita. Let's go.

1999
02:04:19,083 --> 02:04:22,958
I promise you, honey.
We're never coming back,

2000
02:04:23,041 --> 02:04:25,958
and we won't see my hideous family again.

2001
02:04:27,791 --> 02:04:30,875
What if we burn their feet,
like CuauhtÃ©moc?

2002
02:04:30,958 --> 02:04:35,041
Would it be in bad taste
if we just kill them

2003
02:04:35,125 --> 02:04:37,083
and bury them behind the house?

2004
02:04:37,166 --> 02:04:40,208
- Don't kill them, Dad!
- Not even as a joke, Rufino.

2005
02:04:40,291 --> 02:04:42,583
Pancho and his family share our blood.

2006
02:04:42,666 --> 02:04:45,166
Anyone who hurts them, will answer to me.

2007
02:04:45,250 --> 02:04:47,125
What should we do, then?

2008
02:04:47,208 --> 02:04:49,750
You're all a bunch of fools.

2009
02:04:50,416 --> 02:04:55,125
We'll settle it the old way,
like they did in the Revolution.

2010
02:04:55,208 --> 02:04:58,083
We're part of the noble masses,

2011
02:04:58,166 --> 02:05:01,375
and we vastly outnumber
those stuck-up shits.

2012
02:05:01,458 --> 02:05:06,000
We'll go into Pancho's room
and take the safe.

2013
02:05:06,083 --> 02:05:08,208
If he catches us,

2014
02:05:08,291 --> 02:05:12,958
we'll say we just wanted
to look at Grandpa's photos,

2015
02:05:13,041 --> 02:05:15,333
because we miss him so very much.

2016
02:05:15,416 --> 02:05:18,583
- How's that?
- Mother, you're a saint.

2017
02:05:19,083 --> 02:05:20,083
Oh, Mom!

2018
02:05:22,041 --> 02:05:25,250
From here to that dry log,
it's exactly 27 steps

2019
02:05:25,333 --> 02:05:26,833
heading to that lamp post.

2020
02:05:27,958 --> 02:05:31,166
- Are we leaving it here?
- Yes, honey.

2021
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:33,166
Seeing as my family lost their minds,

2022
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:35,541
it's best to remove
the temptation altogether.

2023
02:05:36,125 --> 02:05:39,125
If they burned our car,
they're capable of anything.

2024
02:05:47,458 --> 02:05:48,458
We're done here.

2025
02:05:49,625 --> 02:05:50,708
Let's go.

2026
02:05:58,708 --> 02:06:00,375
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

2027
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,708
Are you okay?

2028
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:40,375
What happened here?

2029
02:06:40,458 --> 02:06:42,500
He shot me! He really shot me!

2030
02:06:46,583 --> 02:06:47,875
Lupe!

2031
02:06:47,958 --> 02:06:49,750
He shot me in the arm!

2032
02:06:56,583 --> 02:06:57,583
Lupe?

2033
02:06:59,041 --> 02:07:00,125
Lupe!

2034
02:07:00,208 --> 02:07:01,750
Get up, Lupe.

2035
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:04,666
Oh, Mom!

2036
02:07:06,083 --> 02:07:07,333
He's dead.

2037
02:07:08,958 --> 02:07:10,500
Murderer!

2038
02:07:11,625 --> 02:07:13,916
Screw you, Pancho!

2039
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:19,166
You killed my Lupe, you bastard!

2040
02:07:21,875 --> 02:07:26,125
You killed my Lupe, you bastard!

2041
02:07:27,416 --> 02:07:29,291
Murderer!

2042
02:07:30,833 --> 02:07:32,208
Pancho!

2043
02:07:50,083 --> 02:07:52,958
Everything will be okay, honey!

2044
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:13,083
Everything will be okay!
It's going to be fine!

2045
02:08:35,958 --> 02:08:38,875
I'm sorry, Pancho. You're fucked.

2046
02:08:38,958 --> 02:08:41,750
No amount of money
will get you out of this mess.

2047
02:08:41,833 --> 02:08:45,625
They broke into my room!
I acted in self-defense.

2048
02:08:45,708 --> 02:08:48,333
Remember I already read you your rights,

2049
02:08:48,416 --> 02:08:50,750
so anything you say
can be used against you.

2050
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:53,375
We'll take your statement
in a little while.

2051
02:08:53,458 --> 02:08:55,000
No, no...

2052
02:08:57,541 --> 02:08:59,916
No. No!

2053
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,166
One more!

2054
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:09,708
That's enough, let me try again.

2055
02:09:10,916 --> 02:09:13,000
You got it, Dad. Put your back into it!

2056
02:09:13,708 --> 02:09:15,208
Come on, Dad.

2057
02:09:15,833 --> 02:09:17,958
This fucking thing can't be opened.

2058
02:09:18,041 --> 02:09:22,000
Have you checked to see
if the safe is unlocked?

2059
02:09:35,833 --> 02:09:37,166
I told you!

2060
02:09:38,208 --> 02:09:41,291
Any other guns in there? Maybe a revolver?

2061
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:48,875
Nothing! Fuck!

2062
02:09:49,583 --> 02:09:52,875
I knew Pancho was smarter
than the rest of us.

2063
02:09:53,666 --> 02:09:55,375
God is punishing us.

2064
02:09:55,458 --> 02:09:58,208
That's what we get for being greedy.

2065
02:09:58,291 --> 02:10:00,416
So much tragedy!

2066
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:03,791
If the treasure's not here,
where did Pancho hide it?

2067
02:10:03,875 --> 02:10:08,166
Who knows?
And after last night, he'll never tell us.

2068
02:10:08,250 --> 02:10:09,416
What now?

2069
02:10:10,125 --> 02:10:14,416
We should try to be there
for Jacinto, I mean, Jacinta!

2070
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,666
They must've released Lupe's body by now.

2071
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:20,041
He shouldn't be alone. I mean, she.

2072
02:10:20,625 --> 02:10:21,750
Or they?

2073
02:10:21,833 --> 02:10:24,041
- Let's go!
- Okay.

2074
02:10:24,625 --> 02:10:27,208
Mom, are you coming to the cemetery?

2075
02:10:27,291 --> 02:10:31,125
Why would I go to the funeral
of that piece of shit?

2076
02:10:31,208 --> 02:10:33,375
If there ever was a silver lining.

2077
02:10:33,458 --> 02:10:39,333
I say Pancho did us a favor
when he killed that pimp.

2078
02:10:40,083 --> 02:10:42,500
He clung to this family
worse than gonorrhea.

2079
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:45,375
Watch the kids, then.

2080
02:10:45,458 --> 02:10:47,708
It's not good for them
to see all this drama.

2081
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:52,333
Give Jacinta a hug for me.

2082
02:10:52,416 --> 02:10:54,750
Sure thing, Mom! Let's go, everyone.

2083
02:10:54,833 --> 02:10:57,083
I swear it was self-defense.

2084
02:10:57,750 --> 02:10:59,583
I believe you, Godson.

2085
02:10:59,666 --> 02:11:04,041
The thing is that homicide,
despite extenuating circumstances,

2086
02:11:04,125 --> 02:11:05,750
is fully prosecuted.

2087
02:11:06,333 --> 02:11:09,375
- How long will the trial last?
- Well, son...

2088
02:11:09,875 --> 02:11:14,250
In this town, six to eight months
before we get a court date.

2089
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:15,916
I see.

2090
02:11:16,625 --> 02:11:19,208
If they find me guilty,
how much time will I get?

2091
02:11:19,958 --> 02:11:21,875
Depends on the judge, son.

2092
02:11:21,958 --> 02:11:23,958
In my experience, though,

2093
02:11:24,541 --> 02:11:27,041
probably a minimum of three to five years.

2094
02:11:27,625 --> 02:11:28,875
Three to five years?

2095
02:11:28,958 --> 02:11:31,375
That's not counting the other wounded.

2096
02:11:31,875 --> 02:11:34,666
No one will believe it was an accident.

2097
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:36,375
I can't do this. Please, Godfather!

2098
02:11:36,458 --> 02:11:39,541
I'm begging you to help me
get out of here.

2099
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:42,625
- Godson, you know I love you.
- I do.

2100
02:11:42,708 --> 02:11:46,541
There's nothing in this country
that can't be solved

2101
02:11:46,625 --> 02:11:47,958
with a lot of money.

2102
02:11:48,666 --> 02:11:51,250
How much do you think
Grandpa's estate is worth?

2103
02:11:51,333 --> 02:11:53,541
Including the contents of the safe.

2104
02:11:54,375 --> 02:11:57,041
Did you also hear about
Grandpa's treasure?

2105
02:11:57,125 --> 02:12:00,333
In this town, there are thieves,

2106
02:12:00,416 --> 02:12:02,000
but no secrets.

2107
02:12:02,083 --> 02:12:04,041
I know it's a fortune.

2108
02:12:05,041 --> 02:12:06,208
Well...

2109
02:12:07,333 --> 02:12:09,916
To be honest with you, it's hard to say.

2110
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,958
I found some gold nuggets,
and some assorted coins.

2111
02:12:14,041 --> 02:12:18,375
The full value must be around three, four...

2112
02:12:18,875 --> 02:12:20,750
five million.

2113
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:23,916
- Is that it?
- Godfather.

2114
02:12:26,083 --> 02:12:28,666
- I swear to God.
- I'll take your word for it.

2115
02:12:28,750 --> 02:12:31,625
Tell your wife, who is waiting outside,

2116
02:12:31,708 --> 02:12:33,625
to bring it here as soon as possible.

2117
02:12:33,708 --> 02:12:36,875
Meanwhile, I'll pull some strings
to see if I can get you out.

2118
02:12:36,958 --> 02:12:38,500
The whole treasure?

2119
02:12:39,166 --> 02:12:42,083
I thought the President
rooted out corruption.

2120
02:12:42,166 --> 02:12:44,583
Godson, you insult me!

2121
02:12:44,666 --> 02:12:46,458
It's not for me!

2122
02:12:46,541 --> 02:12:49,291
There are plenty of people
who haven't committed

2123
02:12:49,375 --> 02:12:51,291
to the transformation of the country!

2124
02:12:51,375 --> 02:12:54,166
I'm going to have to bribe the judge,

2125
02:12:54,250 --> 02:12:57,083
the district attorney,
and the state prosecutor.

2126
02:12:57,166 --> 02:13:00,250
By the end, you might
end up owing me money.

2127
02:13:00,333 --> 02:13:02,041
I'm sorry, Godfather.

2128
02:13:02,875 --> 02:13:05,083
I swear I'll give you the whole treasure,

2129
02:13:05,833 --> 02:13:08,875
but you need to help me
get out of this place.

2130
02:13:08,958 --> 02:13:10,250
Very well, then.

2131
02:13:10,333 --> 02:13:12,500
Tell your wife to bring it over,

2132
02:13:12,583 --> 02:13:17,500
and I'll call in some favors
to get you out of here.

2133
02:13:17,583 --> 02:13:20,500
- Thank you, Godfather.
- God bless.

2134
02:13:25,875 --> 02:13:26,875
Watch him.

2135
02:13:32,833 --> 02:13:34,041
Fucking hell.

2136
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:51,666
I'll open the gate.

2137
02:14:17,583 --> 02:14:19,833
Come on! Try a little!

2138
02:14:21,125 --> 02:14:22,333
Do something.

2139
02:14:28,750 --> 02:14:30,625
- Why not here?
- No way!

2140
02:14:34,041 --> 02:14:35,791
- Pancho!
- Pancho...

2141
02:14:35,875 --> 02:14:37,791
- You have a visitor.
- My love!

2142
02:14:38,416 --> 02:14:40,666
- How are you, love?
- Honey!

2143
02:14:42,375 --> 02:14:45,333
- I'm worried, desperate.
- What should we do?

2144
02:14:45,416 --> 02:14:48,125
Why not hire a lawyer to handle this?

2145
02:14:48,208 --> 02:14:51,166
Imagine the kind of lawyer
we'll find in Prosperidad.

2146
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:53,250
So, what's the plan?

2147
02:14:53,333 --> 02:14:55,666
I have to turn over the gold
to Uncle Regino.

2148
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:57,708
- What?
- I know. I know.

2149
02:14:57,791 --> 02:15:00,916
I don't like it, what if we do it
and he keeps you here?

2150
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,916
I can't stay in this hellhole
for five years, Mari.

2151
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,750
We have to risk it.

2152
02:15:06,833 --> 02:15:10,500
I hope you're right because
I'm not staying here that long.

2153
02:15:12,125 --> 02:15:13,041
I know.

2154
02:15:13,958 --> 02:15:17,291
Get the shovel and dig out the treasure.

2155
02:15:17,375 --> 02:15:20,708
You're only taking out one of the bags.

2156
02:15:20,791 --> 02:15:24,250
Leave the rest where it is.
This is very important,

2157
02:15:24,333 --> 02:15:26,750
be very careful with those vultures.

2158
02:15:26,833 --> 02:15:28,208
Pancho!

2159
02:15:28,291 --> 02:15:31,083
The rules say no whispering. Cut it out.

2160
02:15:35,333 --> 02:15:38,458
- Where are the kids?
- Outside, waiting with Lupita.

2161
02:15:38,541 --> 02:15:41,125
They wouldn't let them in,
visiting hours are over.

2162
02:15:41,208 --> 02:15:42,375
I mean, please.

2163
02:15:42,875 --> 02:15:45,791
- Well, do what I said.
- Sure

2164
02:15:45,875 --> 02:15:48,250
If you don't take too long,
I could get out today.

2165
02:15:48,333 --> 02:15:50,916
- Sure, my love.
- I love you.

2166
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,166
- It's a good plan.
- Be careful.

2167
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:56,041
- Please be quick, don't take too long.
- No, my love.

2168
02:16:15,458 --> 02:16:17,041
Hi, there!

2169
02:16:17,125 --> 02:16:19,416
How many years in the can

2170
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:23,750
are they giving my murderous grandson?

2171
02:16:24,416 --> 02:16:25,916
Old hag.

2172
02:16:29,208 --> 02:16:31,291
Help me, kids. You too, Lupita.

2173
02:16:31,791 --> 02:16:33,750
We're taking a few things.

2174
02:16:40,708 --> 02:16:41,958
Brayan!

2175
02:16:42,625 --> 02:16:43,708
Come here.

2176
02:16:46,583 --> 02:16:50,833
- What is it, Grandma?
- Go see where they go.

2177
02:16:52,375 --> 02:16:53,416
Come on!

2178
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:09,833
...16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

2179
02:17:09,916 --> 02:17:15,208
22, 23, four, five, six, and seven.

2180
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,250
Facing the lamp post.

2181
02:17:20,250 --> 02:17:21,541
I hope this is it.

2182
02:17:22,083 --> 02:17:25,333
Give me a hand, Lupita. Bring the pickaxe.

2183
02:17:25,416 --> 02:17:27,250
- Yes, ma'am.
- Kids!

2184
02:17:27,333 --> 02:17:30,500
- Find something to help me.
- Yes, Mom!

2185
02:17:31,083 --> 02:17:33,791
- What are we looking for?
- Don't ask, just help me.

2186
02:17:33,875 --> 02:17:34,750
Mom!

2187
02:17:35,291 --> 02:17:36,708
- Your turn.
- Yes.

2188
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:40,083
- Here it goes.
- That's better.

2189
02:17:42,958 --> 02:17:44,916
The soil is too hard.

2190
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,583
Try the pickaxe.

2191
02:17:47,583 --> 02:17:48,750
- Again?
- Yes.

2192
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:51,583
We need to loosen it.

2193
02:17:53,833 --> 02:17:55,291
Come here, kids.

2194
02:17:58,375 --> 02:17:59,833
Keep going.

2195
02:18:00,916 --> 02:18:03,666
Help me find... something.

2196
02:18:04,166 --> 02:18:07,125
If we do it,
I'll give you one dollar each.

2197
02:18:09,125 --> 02:18:10,250
Do it again.

2198
02:18:18,666 --> 02:18:20,500
- Hold on.
- Keep digging.

2199
02:18:21,458 --> 02:18:22,541
You, too.

2200
02:18:24,166 --> 02:18:29,250
The madame is going crazy,
digging holes everywhere?

2201
02:18:29,333 --> 02:18:32,666
I think she's looking for
Uncle Pancho's treasure.

2202
02:18:32,750 --> 02:18:37,458
Run to the cemetery and tell your grandpa.

2203
02:18:37,541 --> 02:18:40,083
Don't let anyone else hear you!

2204
02:18:40,166 --> 02:18:42,208
- Run like fuck, son!
- Yes, Grandma.

2205
02:18:58,833 --> 02:19:02,000
You should all learn
from what happened here.

2206
02:19:02,625 --> 02:19:05,375
The Lord always works in mysterious ways.

2207
02:19:05,458 --> 02:19:10,000
Like with Sodom and Gomorrah,
God has punished your greed.

2208
02:19:12,041 --> 02:19:13,166
Let us pray.

2209
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:26,333
Hey, Ambrosio! Where's the eulogy?

2210
02:19:27,125 --> 02:19:31,000
For that pimp? Who's paying, Rosendo?

2211
02:19:31,083 --> 02:19:35,625
You should be grateful
I came to pray the rosary.

2212
02:19:38,583 --> 02:19:39,708
Oh, Lupe!

2213
02:19:40,750 --> 02:19:43,291
- Take me with you!
- Girl.

2214
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:44,958
Hey, girl!

2215
02:19:45,625 --> 02:19:47,208
Let us fucking pray!

2216
02:19:56,583 --> 02:19:59,166
They're digging out the treasure.

2217
02:19:59,250 --> 02:20:02,833
Run back. Son?
They're looking for the treasure.

2218
02:20:02,916 --> 02:20:04,083
Hurry up.

2219
02:20:04,833 --> 02:20:08,041
- They're getting the treasure.
- The treasure!

2220
02:20:08,125 --> 02:20:10,375
- What is it, Mom?
- It's the treasure!

2221
02:20:20,125 --> 02:20:23,000
What's this, now? Where is everyone?

2222
02:20:23,541 --> 02:20:26,208
I apologize for my family,

2223
02:20:26,291 --> 02:20:29,500
but Mari is supposedly
looking for the treasure.

2224
02:20:29,583 --> 02:20:32,250
- That's why they left.
- Rest in peace, amen.

2225
02:20:32,333 --> 02:20:34,750
My daughter, that's all from me.

2226
02:20:34,833 --> 02:20:39,041
Stay with your man, I have to run.
I want to prevent another tragedy!

2227
02:20:39,125 --> 02:20:40,250
- Uncle!
- God bless.

2228
02:20:40,333 --> 02:20:43,125
See you later, Jacinta. God have mercy!

2229
02:20:43,208 --> 02:20:46,041
- Don't go, girls.
- Bartola, help me!

2230
02:20:46,125 --> 02:20:48,541
Wait for us, Uncle!

2231
02:20:48,625 --> 02:20:52,916
Baby, I'll be back soon.
You know these assholes,

2232
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,375
if I don't hurry up, they'll take it all.

2233
02:20:55,458 --> 02:20:57,750
In the name of the cross.

2234
02:20:59,125 --> 02:21:00,541
Wait for me!

2235
02:21:16,083 --> 02:21:17,958
What's this, Mariquita?

2236
02:21:18,541 --> 02:21:19,833
Can we help?

2237
02:21:21,208 --> 02:21:22,333
Oh, Don Rosendo.

2238
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:26,625
We buried the treasure here,
but I can't find it!

2239
02:21:28,166 --> 02:21:30,875
If we don't give it to Regino today,

2240
02:21:30,958 --> 02:21:33,250
he won't let Pancho get out of jail.

2241
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:34,958
My goodness.

2242
02:21:35,875 --> 02:21:38,083
Why didn't you mark the spot?

2243
02:21:38,166 --> 02:21:43,000
We did, but I can't find it.
It was too dark, I couldn't see.

2244
02:21:43,083 --> 02:21:46,375
Everything looked different,
I'm not sure anymore.

2245
02:21:46,958 --> 02:21:49,416
Don't worry, we're here to help.

2246
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:51,750
If we all pitch in,
we'll find it in no time.

2247
02:21:51,833 --> 02:21:55,750
Everyone, get to the house
and bring shovels, pickaxes,

2248
02:21:55,833 --> 02:21:58,458
hoes, and wheelbarrows.
My daughter-in-law needs help!

2249
02:21:58,541 --> 02:22:00,083
- Yes, Dad.
- Hurry up!

2250
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:05,833
Let me help you, you take a break.

2251
02:22:05,916 --> 02:22:09,583
One, two, three, four, five, wait, no.

2252
02:22:29,458 --> 02:22:32,250
Mari, my love!

2253
02:22:33,125 --> 02:22:36,041
- What took you so long?
- Oh, Fran!

2254
02:22:36,541 --> 02:22:40,625
It was a nightmare finding the treasure.
At first we couldn't find it.

2255
02:22:40,708 --> 02:22:44,541
Thank God your family helped,
so we finally found it.

2256
02:22:44,625 --> 02:22:47,250
At least you're here now
and this will be over soon.

2257
02:22:47,333 --> 02:22:49,583
- I know, my love.
- Let's see.

2258
02:23:01,291 --> 02:23:02,375
Mari...

2259
02:23:02,875 --> 02:23:05,125
Mari, where's the gold?
These are just rocks.

2260
02:23:05,208 --> 02:23:06,125
Oh, Fran.

2261
02:23:06,708 --> 02:23:09,625
Forgive me, but I've decided
what to do with the gold.

2262
02:23:09,708 --> 02:23:11,708
What I've always dreamed of.

2263
02:23:11,791 --> 02:23:16,208
I'm buying houses, cars,
jewelry, yachts, clothes.

2264
02:23:16,291 --> 02:23:19,125
Mari, don't do this to me!

2265
02:23:19,208 --> 02:23:21,500
Please forgive me,
but an opportunity like this

2266
02:23:21,583 --> 02:23:24,250
only comes once in a lifetime,

2267
02:23:24,333 --> 02:23:26,500
and this is mine.

2268
02:23:28,833 --> 02:23:30,500
- Bye!
- Wait, Mari.

2269
02:23:31,541 --> 02:23:33,708
Mari, please don't. Don't do this to me!

2270
02:23:33,791 --> 02:23:36,791
Mari, please don't do this!

2271
02:23:39,250 --> 02:23:40,833
No, no!

2272
02:23:47,125 --> 02:23:50,250
What kind of dream was that?
You were screaming.

2273
02:23:50,333 --> 02:23:51,708
It was nothing, officer.

2274
02:23:52,375 --> 02:23:56,041
Any news from my wife or my relatives?

2275
02:23:56,666 --> 02:23:58,125
No, sir, nothing.

2276
02:24:00,083 --> 02:24:01,208
Thanks.

2277
02:24:10,208 --> 02:24:14,125
- What's going on?
- You didn't hear?

2278
02:24:15,125 --> 02:24:17,583
It seems Rosendo's son

2279
02:24:17,666 --> 02:24:21,041
buried a huge treasure
here in the property.

2280
02:24:21,125 --> 02:24:24,208
Whoever finds it first is getting half.

2281
02:24:24,291 --> 02:24:26,291
What if someone finds it and keeps quiet?

2282
02:24:26,375 --> 02:24:29,541
Well, then... I guess they'd keep it all.

2283
02:24:30,041 --> 02:24:32,250
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's do it.

2284
02:24:32,833 --> 02:24:35,000
Let's see who finds it first.

2285
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:40,291
- Do it right, babe!
- What the hell?

2286
02:24:40,375 --> 02:24:42,458
- Sorry about that.
- I thought you were hurt.

2287
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:46,125
Grab a shovel, then. Come on!

2288
02:24:57,208 --> 02:25:00,791
- Did you find anything, dear?
- Nothing yet, Don Rosendo.

2289
02:25:01,291 --> 02:25:05,666
With all these new holes,
we may never find it.

2290
02:25:05,750 --> 02:25:08,000
- This place is unrecognizable.
- Don't worry.

2291
02:25:08,083 --> 02:25:11,125
We know all these folks,
they're honest people.

2292
02:25:11,208 --> 02:25:14,583
I'll make sure we don't stop
until we find that treasure.

2293
02:25:14,666 --> 02:25:17,708
Mari, my dear.
I brought you food and water.

2294
02:25:17,791 --> 02:25:19,208
What if we don't find it,

2295
02:25:19,291 --> 02:25:22,041
and Pancho is stuck in jail
for five years?

2296
02:25:22,125 --> 02:25:24,833
Oh, my God. He must be desperate.

2297
02:25:25,791 --> 02:25:28,916
I'm going to find the spot right now.

2298
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,583
Right now!

2299
02:25:43,041 --> 02:25:46,000
- Any news from my wife?
- Nothing yet.

2300
02:25:46,083 --> 02:25:50,833
- My dad is getting pretty mad.
- What's taking her so long?

2301
02:25:50,916 --> 02:25:54,458
Rumor has it, the treasure's lost.
They can't find it anywhere.

2302
02:25:54,541 --> 02:25:57,625
What if you break me out
so I can find it myself?

2303
02:25:57,708 --> 02:26:01,291
What if you never come back?
In your dreams!

2304
02:26:01,375 --> 02:26:03,791
Could you run it by my godfather?

2305
02:26:03,875 --> 02:26:08,375
I did, he said if in 24 hours,
the treasure doesn't turn up,

2306
02:26:08,458 --> 02:26:11,375
I should take you straight
to the state penitentiary.

2307
02:26:11,458 --> 02:26:12,666
You've been warned.

2308
02:26:17,625 --> 02:26:20,583
For fuck's sake! What could've gone wrong?

2309
02:26:25,583 --> 02:26:26,833
Here's something!

2310
02:26:30,458 --> 02:26:31,708
Let me see, son.

2311
02:26:31,791 --> 02:26:34,875
All right, Rosendo. Give it here.

2312
02:26:39,375 --> 02:26:43,291
It's Fulgencio's skull.

2313
02:26:43,875 --> 02:26:46,708
- Look at this.
- How can you tell?

2314
02:26:46,791 --> 02:26:50,333
- It could be anyone!
- What about this?

2315
02:26:50,416 --> 02:26:54,708
I was there when your father
shot him in the head.

2316
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:57,708
It still smells like him.

2317
02:26:58,208 --> 02:27:01,166
Who was this Fulgencio?
Why did my dad shoot him?

2318
02:27:01,250 --> 02:27:02,750
I dated him once.

2319
02:27:02,833 --> 02:27:06,125
One day, your father caught us cheating,

2320
02:27:06,208 --> 02:27:10,166
so he shot him eight times,
but this one was the one.

2321
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:12,875
This was the one that killed him.
Right here.

2322
02:27:12,958 --> 02:27:16,166
- Where are you going, Mariquita?
- This is insane, Don Rosendo.

2323
02:27:16,875 --> 02:27:18,333
We didn't dig that deep.

2324
02:27:18,416 --> 02:27:21,458
We won't find it soon, maybe not ever.

2325
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,833
I should go see Pancho,

2326
02:27:23,916 --> 02:27:27,083
tell him what's going on,
and come up with a plan.

2327
02:27:27,166 --> 02:27:29,000
Don't you worry, dear.

2328
02:27:29,083 --> 02:27:32,875
As sure as I'm Rosendo Reyes
I'll keep digging until I find it,

2329
02:27:32,958 --> 02:27:34,791
even if it takes me a thousand years.

2330
02:27:35,541 --> 02:27:36,625
Let's go, kids.

2331
02:27:37,791 --> 02:27:38,875
Come on.

2332
02:27:42,125 --> 02:27:45,708
Wake up, fuckers!
We're only getting started!

2333
02:27:45,791 --> 02:27:48,875
Come on, Rufino, Hilario,
Socorro, Jacinta!

2334
02:27:48,958 --> 02:27:51,250
You too, Bartola! Let's get to work.

2335
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,500
We're exhausted, Dad!

2336
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,791
I'm at my wit's end, Pancho.

2337
02:27:59,875 --> 02:28:03,750
I can't stay with your family.
They're the worst, Pancho.

2338
02:28:05,458 --> 02:28:08,208
Just take the kids and go back home.

2339
02:28:08,291 --> 02:28:10,416
And leave you here? Don't say that!

2340
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:13,375
If you return to the city,
we'll have more options.

2341
02:28:13,458 --> 02:28:15,708
We could get a loan, pawn something off,

2342
02:28:15,791 --> 02:28:17,500
or hire a good lawyer.

2343
02:28:17,583 --> 02:28:18,583
One more thing,

2344
02:28:19,083 --> 02:28:22,083
I need you to tell Don Jaime
what's going on.

2345
02:28:22,166 --> 02:28:24,916
The last thing I need is to lose my job.

2346
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,416
Pancho, I can't just leave you here.

2347
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:30,916
The kids won't be happy
to go home without their dad.

2348
02:28:32,625 --> 02:28:34,750
All right, kids. What do you want?

2349
02:28:35,541 --> 02:28:38,500
Do you want to go home
with Lupita and Mom?

2350
02:28:38,583 --> 02:28:42,250
Or stay at your grandparents'
and wait for Dad to get out.

2351
02:28:42,333 --> 02:28:46,958
- I want to go home, Dad.
- I hate this stinking town.

2352
02:28:47,041 --> 02:28:49,250
- See, honey?
- Pancho, step back.

2353
02:28:49,333 --> 02:28:51,750
I'm going to let you say your goodbyes.

2354
02:29:00,458 --> 02:29:01,833
Make it quick.

2355
02:29:01,916 --> 02:29:04,291
Don't forget how much I love you.

2356
02:29:04,375 --> 02:29:06,375
- Time's up.
- Don't forget.

2357
02:29:06,458 --> 02:29:08,583
- I won't.
- Bye, kids.

2358
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:11,500
- Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

2359
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:15,000
Goodbye, my love.

2360
02:29:26,625 --> 02:29:29,833
Goodbye, Don Rosendo.
Farewell, DoÃ±a Dolores.

2361
02:29:29,916 --> 02:29:32,125
Give my regards to everyone,
and I beg of you,

2362
02:29:32,208 --> 02:29:35,041
never ever abandon my Pancho.

2363
02:29:35,125 --> 02:29:37,083
Don't worry, dear.

2364
02:29:37,166 --> 02:29:39,958
- Let's go, Lupita.
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I have some news.

2365
02:29:40,041 --> 02:29:43,250
Guess what? I'm staying here.

2366
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:47,250
Rosendito proposed and I said yes!

2367
02:29:48,458 --> 02:29:52,583
- Have you thought this through?
- Of course I have.

2368
02:29:54,041 --> 02:29:56,708
So... does that mean we'll be related?

2369
02:29:56,791 --> 02:29:59,625
- Oh, yes.
- Well, congratulations.

2370
02:29:59,708 --> 02:30:03,083
Thank you, sis.
We'll send you an invite soon.

2371
02:30:03,166 --> 02:30:06,166
As soon as we set a date. Safe travels!

2372
02:30:06,250 --> 02:30:07,583
Bye, Cati.

2373
02:30:07,666 --> 02:30:09,583
Bye, Toni. Come visit, okay?

2374
02:30:09,666 --> 02:30:13,583
- Be good to your mom.
- Let's go, kids.

2375
02:30:21,708 --> 02:30:23,333
- Bye.
- Hey, Mom?

2376
02:30:23,958 --> 02:30:27,333
- Is Lupita our aunt now?
- Is she, Mom?

2377
02:30:27,416 --> 02:30:30,833
Don't even joke about that.
You're dead if you tell anyone.

2378
02:30:42,333 --> 02:30:47,833
Godson, I'm truly sorry
you're in this situation.

2379
02:30:47,916 --> 02:30:51,750
I already talked to the judge.
He said no money, no dice.

2380
02:30:51,833 --> 02:30:55,125
I've been locked up for over ten days!

2381
02:30:55,208 --> 02:30:57,791
My family hasn't stopped
looking for the treasure.

2382
02:30:59,500 --> 02:31:03,500
Just let me out of here.
I swear I know where it is.

2383
02:31:03,583 --> 02:31:05,791
I wish I could!

2384
02:31:06,541 --> 02:31:08,583
These are no longer the good old days.

2385
02:31:08,666 --> 02:31:12,958
If the judge finds out
my relative got special treatment,

2386
02:31:13,041 --> 02:31:15,416
we'd both be fucked.

2387
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:17,750
I'm begging you, Godfather.

2388
02:31:19,416 --> 02:31:21,916
Just name your price.

2389
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,541
Anything at all! Just get me out of here.

2390
02:31:27,625 --> 02:31:29,583
Are you sure, Pancho?

2391
02:31:33,208 --> 02:31:34,625
Anything, Godfather.

2392
02:31:35,208 --> 02:31:39,583
I'd sell my soul to the devil
to get out of this place.

2393
02:31:42,208 --> 02:31:45,541
Officer, send in the notary.

2394
02:31:45,625 --> 02:31:49,083
Tell him to bring the contracts.

2395
02:32:08,375 --> 02:32:09,625
Look, everyone!

2396
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,291
Uncle Pancho's here! They cut him loose!

2397
02:32:18,125 --> 02:32:21,583
Grandpa, Grandma!
They released Uncle Pancho!

2398
02:32:24,708 --> 02:32:28,625
Pancho Francisco Reyes!
It's good to see you free.

2399
02:32:28,708 --> 02:32:31,041
- I'm so glad to see you!
- Oh, Pancho.

2400
02:32:31,125 --> 02:32:34,041
You're nothing but skin and bones!
Can I make you something?

2401
02:32:34,125 --> 02:32:35,625
No thanks, Mom.

2402
02:32:38,166 --> 02:32:40,416
Why aren't you back in the city?

2403
02:32:40,500 --> 02:32:44,750
Well, sir, I've moved in with Rosendito.

2404
02:32:44,833 --> 02:32:47,125
We're engaged, and we're expecting.

2405
02:32:47,875 --> 02:32:50,958
God makes them and the devil pairs them.

2406
02:32:51,041 --> 02:32:53,583
What happened, Panchito?

2407
02:32:53,666 --> 02:32:55,916
Did you drop the soap back in prison?

2408
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:59,375
Or, did you manage to save
the family's honor?

2409
02:33:11,833 --> 02:33:12,916
Come on, fucker.

2410
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,875
Kids, get dressed!

2411
02:33:17,958 --> 02:33:21,458
Get shovels and pickaxes.
Let's help Pancho!

2412
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:38,208
...23, 24, 25, 26 and 27.

2413
02:34:03,083 --> 02:34:06,833
See? My dear Mari was right!
This is the right spot.

2414
02:34:07,416 --> 02:34:09,791
Grab your shovels, and let's help him--

2415
02:34:09,875 --> 02:34:12,458
You know what, Dad?
I'd rather do it alone.

2416
02:34:12,541 --> 02:34:14,458
If you start digging wherever you please,

2417
02:34:14,541 --> 02:34:16,458
I won't find anything in this mess.

2418
02:34:17,583 --> 02:34:20,750
Mind if we stick around
to keep you company?

2419
02:34:20,833 --> 02:34:22,875
You know, for moral support.

2420
02:34:46,333 --> 02:34:48,125
Afternoon, Grandma.

2421
02:34:49,666 --> 02:34:53,291
- Did Pancho find the treasure?
- Nothing yet.

2422
02:34:53,375 --> 02:34:56,458
I think that the gold is lost forever,

2423
02:34:56,541 --> 02:35:00,750
and that sucker is just
completely deluded.

2424
02:35:00,833 --> 02:35:03,625
Don't say that, Grandma.
His heart is set on it.

2425
02:35:03,708 --> 02:35:07,000
God willing,
he'll find it one of these days.

2426
02:35:07,083 --> 02:35:11,125
What Pancho ought to do
is give up on the whole thing,

2427
02:35:11,208 --> 02:35:14,291
go back where he came from,
and leave us alone.

2428
02:35:14,375 --> 02:35:18,250
- We were better off without him.
- You're so mean.

2429
02:35:18,333 --> 02:35:23,125
- Don't you fear God?
- You're the ones who should fear Him!

2430
02:35:23,208 --> 02:35:27,000
Instead of working your way up
like decent people,

2431
02:35:27,083 --> 02:35:32,875
you're sucking up to him,
to see if he throws you a bone.

2432
02:35:33,916 --> 02:35:36,666
Come on, girls.
Beans don't cook themselves.

2433
02:35:37,375 --> 02:35:41,333
"Look at me. Beans don't cook themselves."

2434
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:45,833
Son, it's getting late.

2435
02:35:46,333 --> 02:35:50,375
Get some sleep,
you'll take it up tomorrow.

2436
02:35:50,458 --> 02:35:54,416
No, I'm not leaving
until I find that treasure.

2437
02:35:54,500 --> 02:35:56,875
I have a feeling I'm getting close.

2438
02:35:56,958 --> 02:35:59,708
- I'm very, very close.
- All right, son.

2439
02:36:00,750 --> 02:36:03,250
See you tomorrow, and good luck.

2440
02:37:54,708 --> 02:37:58,041
Son, please stop!

2441
02:38:51,958 --> 02:38:53,916
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.</i>

2442
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,708
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women,

2443
02:38:56,791 --> 02:38:58,541
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

2444
02:38:58,625 --> 02:39:02,166
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

2445
02:39:02,250 --> 02:39:04,625
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

2446
02:39:04,708 --> 02:39:06,333
Grant him eternal rest,

2447
02:39:06,416 --> 02:39:08,458
and let perpetual light shine upon him.

2448
02:39:08,541 --> 02:39:11,916
May our Pancho's soul
and those in Purgatory

2449
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,041
forever rest in peace. Amen.

2450
02:39:14,125 --> 02:39:15,166
Amen.

2451
02:39:15,250 --> 02:39:19,166
Ambrosio, isn't it a bit much
to take him for dead?

2452
02:39:19,250 --> 02:39:20,250
He's still alive.

2453
02:39:20,833 --> 02:39:23,458
I'm not taking him for dead, God forbid!

2454
02:39:23,541 --> 02:39:26,750
Pancho, just like St. Anthony,
has got the devil in him.

2455
02:39:26,833 --> 02:39:30,458
It's up to us to do what we can
to save his soul.

2456
02:39:30,541 --> 02:39:33,333
The doctor said there's still hope.

2457
02:39:33,416 --> 02:39:34,875
Oh, Dolores.

2458
02:39:34,958 --> 02:39:37,750
Twenty days and nights
without food or sleep,

2459
02:39:37,833 --> 02:39:40,083
digging that hellish hole.

2460
02:39:40,166 --> 02:39:43,208
Lying there another ten days
like Saint Simon.

2461
02:39:43,291 --> 02:39:45,541
Do you really think he's going to wake up?

2462
02:39:45,625 --> 02:39:49,541
What about a miracle?
Don't you believe in those?

2463
02:39:49,625 --> 02:39:51,416
Rosendo, don't be naive.

2464
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:53,833
God grants miracles to good people,

2465
02:39:53,916 --> 02:39:55,083
and in this family,

2466
02:39:55,708 --> 02:39:59,291
maybe just one of the kids
will be spared from Hell.

2467
02:39:59,375 --> 02:40:02,500
You shut your mouth, bird of ill omen.

2468
02:40:02,583 --> 02:40:05,416
Oh, my God. So much tragedy.

2469
02:40:05,500 --> 02:40:07,625
Why did this happen to us?

2470
02:40:09,333 --> 02:40:13,583
God, please, grant us a miracle.

2471
02:40:21,416 --> 02:40:22,541
I'm leaving.

2472
02:40:23,166 --> 02:40:26,333
I'm getting out of here
and going back to my family.

2473
02:40:28,208 --> 02:40:30,833
It's a miracle!

2474
02:40:45,375 --> 02:40:46,791
- Goodbye, brother.
- God bless.

2475
02:40:46,875 --> 02:40:50,166
Thanks for everything. You're a good man.

2476
02:40:50,791 --> 02:40:53,291
See you, brother.
Give our love to your family.

2477
02:40:53,375 --> 02:40:55,500
See you at the wedding. Right, Lupita?

2478
02:40:55,583 --> 02:40:58,916
Mr. Pancho, sorry I let you
and Mrs. Mari down.

2479
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,666
I called my sister in San Pedro
to fill in for me.

2480
02:41:01,750 --> 02:41:05,625
No need, sis.
Mari and I will figure it out.

2481
02:41:06,375 --> 02:41:09,291
Pancho, God help you and keep you safe.

2482
02:41:09,375 --> 02:41:13,041
Tell Mari about the miracle
so that she knows He exists.

2483
02:41:14,916 --> 02:41:17,416
The dark swallows shall one day return!

2484
02:41:17,500 --> 02:41:18,666
Bye, Pancho.

2485
02:41:19,500 --> 02:41:22,458
If you're ever in town
and you're feeling sad,

2486
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:24,125
I'll be around.

2487
02:41:24,208 --> 02:41:26,416
My brother. My soul brother.

2488
02:41:28,708 --> 02:41:32,458
I wish you luck.
I hope you rebuild your life.

2489
02:41:33,291 --> 02:41:38,000
Pancho, thank you for getting rid of Lupe.

2490
02:41:39,375 --> 02:41:43,083
This is all I could recover
from your things.

2491
02:41:43,625 --> 02:41:46,291
I love you very much,
and I'll fucking miss you.

2492
02:41:46,375 --> 02:41:48,000
Give my love to my niece and nephew.

2493
02:41:51,958 --> 02:41:54,125
I'm finally leaving, Grandma.

2494
02:41:54,833 --> 02:41:58,416
I guess you're happy
to get rid of my snotty self.

2495
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:02,958
I may have won the battle,
but I lost the war.

2496
02:42:03,041 --> 02:42:06,125
Just for today, let's make a truce.

2497
02:42:06,208 --> 02:42:11,250
Give me a kiss, as I'm sure
we won't see each other again.

2498
02:42:13,083 --> 02:42:14,458
Bye, Grandma.

2499
02:42:18,458 --> 02:42:21,708
God bless you, son.
Don't hold a grudge against us,

2500
02:42:21,791 --> 02:42:23,583
and come back soon.

2501
02:42:24,416 --> 02:42:27,458
Don't worry, Mom. It's all forgiven.

2502
02:42:33,250 --> 02:42:34,583
Goodbye, Dad.

2503
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:37,416
I sincerely wish you all the best.

2504
02:42:38,125 --> 02:42:41,250
I hope you'll forgive me one day
and hold no grudge.

2505
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:44,375
What's there to forgive?

2506
02:42:44,458 --> 02:42:48,000
We're blessed to have a son
as good as you.

2507
02:42:48,958 --> 02:42:52,083
I promise you that,
even if it costs me my life,

2508
02:42:52,166 --> 02:42:55,458
I won't give up
until I find your treasure.

2509
02:42:55,541 --> 02:42:58,208
Even if it takes me forever and a day.

2510
02:42:58,291 --> 02:42:59,791
Forever and a day!

2511
02:43:01,833 --> 02:43:02,958
Goodbye, Dad.

2512
02:43:07,041 --> 02:43:07,916
Goodbye, kids!

2513
02:43:09,250 --> 02:43:11,833
- Bye, kids.
- Goodbye.

2514
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:21,250
Goodbye, son.

2515
02:43:22,041 --> 02:43:23,375
Pancho...

2516
02:43:56,416 --> 02:43:58,125
Fucking Grandpa.

2517
02:43:59,208 --> 02:44:02,375
I'll always wonder
if you did this on purpose,

2518
02:44:03,375 --> 02:44:07,000
or if you ruined our lives
out of sheer bad luck.

2519
02:44:07,666 --> 02:44:09,875
But knowing you as well as I did,

2520
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:14,583
I'm sure than none of this
was a coincidence.

2521
02:44:15,625 --> 02:44:17,291
Wherever you are,

2522
02:44:18,375 --> 02:44:20,916
I'm sure you must be laughing your ass off

2523
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,625
as you watch our lives crumble around us.

2524
02:44:25,250 --> 02:44:27,250
In honor of your memory,

2525
02:44:28,041 --> 02:44:32,125
and better than the mausoleum
you wanted so badly,

2526
02:44:32,875 --> 02:44:35,416
I'm going to do something
that will make you proud.

2527
02:44:36,208 --> 02:44:39,750
Something you will never,
ever forget, Grandpa.

2528
02:45:11,125 --> 02:45:12,750
What's this, Pancho?

2529
02:45:12,833 --> 02:45:14,916
You're leaving without saying goodbye?

2530
02:45:15,500 --> 02:45:19,000
It's time I leave, Godfather,
hopefully for good.

2531
02:45:19,083 --> 02:45:21,208
Did you find anything?

2532
02:45:21,291 --> 02:45:22,125
No.

2533
02:45:22,625 --> 02:45:26,250
What a shame,
but I'm glad you gave up such madness

2534
02:45:26,333 --> 02:45:28,583
and recovered your reason and your sanity.

2535
02:45:28,666 --> 02:45:32,666
Here's a copy of the contract,
certified by the notary.

2536
02:45:32,750 --> 02:45:36,166
- Check it before you leave.
- No need, Godfather.

2537
02:45:36,250 --> 02:45:39,708
All I ask is that you're not
too tough on my family.

2538
02:45:40,208 --> 02:45:44,125
Who do you take me for?
Pascuala is my mother.

2539
02:45:44,833 --> 02:45:49,166
Your father shares my blood,
and I adore your siblings.

2540
02:45:53,750 --> 02:45:56,458
- See you, Commander.
- Bye, Pancho!

2541
02:45:56,541 --> 02:45:59,708
This is goodbye, Godfather.
Look after my family.

2542
02:45:59,791 --> 02:46:02,083
I told you, get that out of your mind.

2543
02:46:02,166 --> 02:46:05,125
The administration's priority
is the well-being of the poor.

2544
02:46:05,208 --> 02:46:08,458
Luckily, your family falls
on the right side of history.

2545
02:46:08,541 --> 02:46:11,041
They are part of the noble, wise masses.

2546
02:46:11,125 --> 02:46:12,250
Godspeed, son.

2547
02:46:19,125 --> 02:46:20,416
- Godfather.
- Yes?

2548
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:22,500
Don't take this the wrong way,

2549
02:46:22,583 --> 02:46:26,708
but this government reminds me
of all the previous ones.

2550
02:46:26,791 --> 02:46:28,833
You're wrong, listen...

2551
02:46:31,750 --> 02:46:33,750
Spoiled, renegade brat.

2552
02:46:33,833 --> 02:46:37,208
The nation will square him up
and put him in his place.

2553
02:46:38,083 --> 02:46:39,500
Reginito.

2554
02:46:39,583 --> 02:46:43,875
Let's pay a visit to the family
and tell them to leave immediately.

2555
02:46:43,958 --> 02:46:45,500
Yes, sir.

2556
02:46:57,416 --> 02:46:59,666
Hey, Dad! Lunch is ready.

2557
02:46:59,750 --> 02:47:02,208
Shall we wait for you
or go ahead without you?

2558
02:47:03,458 --> 02:47:05,000
Let's go, son.

2559
02:47:05,083 --> 02:47:07,625
- No luck?
- None, my girl.

2560
02:47:08,166 --> 02:47:12,125
If we keep digging,
we'll reach China one day.

2561
02:47:12,625 --> 02:47:13,583
Let's go!

2562
02:47:15,166 --> 02:47:16,208
Careful.

2563
02:47:26,416 --> 02:47:29,250
Lazy, good-for-nothing sons of bitches.

2564
02:47:30,125 --> 02:47:31,083
Hell!

2565
02:47:31,708 --> 02:47:32,875
Don't mind him.

2566
02:47:35,041 --> 02:47:36,458
Morning, Mom.

2567
02:47:50,875 --> 02:47:53,750
- Is this all that's left?
- Good thing they ate,

2568
02:47:53,833 --> 02:47:56,458
because we have nothing for tomorrow.

2569
02:47:58,875 --> 02:48:03,000
Don Rosendo,
I can get some cactus for you.

2570
02:48:03,083 --> 02:48:04,583
Okay.

2571
02:48:04,666 --> 02:48:08,625
Fuck you a thousand times,
Francisco Reyes!

2572
02:48:09,375 --> 02:48:12,041
This is all your fault.

2573
02:48:12,125 --> 02:48:15,375
You better be rotting in Hell.

2574
02:48:15,458 --> 02:48:21,500
And I hope your shitty grandson
joins you soon enough.

2575
02:48:21,583 --> 02:48:24,916
What's the point of crying?

2576
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:28,875
Don Rosendo, come quick! We're screwed!

2577
02:48:28,958 --> 02:48:31,500
Come on, this is serious!

2578
02:48:31,583 --> 02:48:33,500
The police are here!

2579
02:48:35,625 --> 02:48:38,708
That must be Regino, trying to evict us.

2580
02:48:38,791 --> 02:48:42,500
Mom, give me that. Son of a bitch!

2581
02:48:45,875 --> 02:48:50,375
<i>Uncle Rosendo,
surrender, please, without resistance.</i>

2582
02:48:50,458 --> 02:48:53,583
Come on, kids. Let's face this fucker!

2583
02:48:56,375 --> 02:48:59,708
<i>Please, surrender without resistance</i>

2584
02:48:59,791 --> 02:49:04,333
<i>I have a judge's order
to evict the property immediately!</i>

2585
02:49:04,416 --> 02:49:06,083
Fuck that, Godson.

2586
02:49:06,166 --> 02:49:10,000
You'll have to kill us all
before your jerk of a father

2587
02:49:10,083 --> 02:49:11,291
takes our house!

2588
02:49:11,375 --> 02:49:14,333
<i>Evacuate the property!</i>

2589
02:49:14,416 --> 02:49:16,875
<i>Don't make me take action.</i>

2590
02:49:18,625 --> 02:49:20,750
<i>I repeat, Godfather!</i>

2591
02:49:20,833 --> 02:49:24,375
<i>Surrender yourselves or I'm going to be
compelled to use the public force.</i>

2592
02:49:25,291 --> 02:49:27,625
Don't be stupid, Rosendo!

2593
02:49:27,708 --> 02:49:29,916
Don't endanger your family.

2594
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:33,375
Evacuate the house
or I'll send in the cops

2595
02:49:33,458 --> 02:49:35,333
and knock down the house on top of you!

2596
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:37,333
Fuck you.

2597
02:49:45,375 --> 02:49:46,375
Fire!

2598
02:49:51,833 --> 02:49:53,583
Advance! Advance!

2599
02:50:17,041 --> 02:50:19,041
Motherfuckers!

2600
02:50:27,375 --> 02:50:29,708
Let go of me!

2601
02:50:29,791 --> 02:50:32,750
Get the hell out of my house!

2602
02:50:32,833 --> 02:50:34,750
Motherfuckers!

2603
02:50:34,833 --> 02:50:37,583
Screw you, Regino!

2604
02:50:37,666 --> 02:50:40,916
I swear on Dad's memory
you'll pay for this.

2605
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:44,916
You and that traitor Pancho
will answer for this!

2606
02:50:57,041 --> 02:50:58,583
Come on, son.

2607
02:50:58,666 --> 02:51:00,750
All this is finally ours.

2608
02:51:02,291 --> 02:51:04,125
Let's get to work.

2609
02:51:22,875 --> 02:51:26,166
Mr. Reyes. Good news.

2610
02:51:26,250 --> 02:51:29,541
Come with us. I think we found it.

2611
02:51:31,708 --> 02:51:35,166
I knew Pancho's treasure
would turn up sooner or later!

2612
02:51:38,833 --> 02:51:41,500
Your nephew came so close to finding it.

2613
02:51:41,583 --> 02:51:44,750
He was wrong by less than two feet.

2614
02:51:44,833 --> 02:51:48,375
- Some people are born unlucky.
- Agreed!

2615
02:51:48,458 --> 02:51:51,333
I have even better news.

2616
02:51:51,416 --> 02:51:53,166
I doubt it's better than this.

2617
02:51:53,250 --> 02:51:58,250
Look what your nephew was about to find.

2618
02:51:58,333 --> 02:52:00,791
A gold-bearing vein
in the old Esperanza mine.

2619
02:52:01,750 --> 02:52:05,500
Rosendo was right all along.

2620
02:52:05,583 --> 02:52:09,916
It's one of the largest veins
ever discovered.

2621
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:11,250
Praise God!

2622
02:52:11,833 --> 02:52:15,041
Rosendo and Pancho, you did it!

2623
02:52:15,125 --> 02:52:18,750
God bless you both! God bless you!

2624
02:52:18,833 --> 02:52:22,708
Sorry, but I also have some bad news.

2625
02:52:22,791 --> 02:52:23,875
What?

2626
02:52:23,958 --> 02:52:26,916
You are forgetting the contract
you signed with us.

2627
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:28,708
All this is ours.

2628
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:32,500
No!

2629
02:52:32,583 --> 02:52:35,208
I didn't sign anything! Not a thing!

2630
02:52:35,291 --> 02:52:37,375
This gold is mine.

2631
02:52:37,458 --> 02:52:40,583
I'm sorry, sir. But the law is the law.

2632
02:52:40,666 --> 02:52:42,916
You signed the contract.

2633
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,500
I'm getting an injunction!

2634
02:52:45,583 --> 02:52:47,750
The gold is mine! I'll get an injunction!

2635
02:52:47,833 --> 02:52:50,166
It's mine, all mine!

2636
02:53:13,916 --> 02:53:17,208
How much longer will they keep us here?

2637
02:53:17,291 --> 02:53:21,041
- It's been over two months.
- Who knows, Lola?

2638
02:53:21,541 --> 02:53:25,375
I guess Regino and Reginito
forgot all about us.

2639
02:53:25,458 --> 02:53:30,041
- We might stay here forever.
- Stop whining.

2640
02:53:30,125 --> 02:53:34,041
At least we're getting three meals a day!

2641
02:53:34,125 --> 02:53:35,333
Listen, family.

2642
02:53:36,250 --> 02:53:40,208
- Get your things, you're free.
- Praise the Lord.

2643
02:53:40,291 --> 02:53:44,875
Why did your shitty father
keep us here for so long?

2644
02:53:44,958 --> 02:53:49,583
Please don't disrespect me
and don't mention my father.

2645
02:53:50,083 --> 02:53:52,333
He's at the hospital, it's very serious.

2646
02:53:52,416 --> 02:53:56,125
I'm the temporary mayor,
I'm in charge now.

2647
02:53:56,208 --> 02:53:58,125
Better hurry up,

2648
02:53:58,208 --> 02:54:01,208
before I change my mind
and add two more months.

2649
02:54:02,625 --> 02:54:05,625
And you, Ambrosio? Where's your cassock?

2650
02:54:05,708 --> 02:54:08,875
I heard God's voice again,
like when I was a kid.

2651
02:54:09,458 --> 02:54:13,833
He told me the Roman Church
is morally bankrupt,

2652
02:54:13,916 --> 02:54:17,166
but the Bible has always
contained the answer.

2653
02:54:17,250 --> 02:54:20,166
Jesus Christ is our savior.

2654
02:54:20,250 --> 02:54:24,291
The end of days are coming,
so take this opportunity

2655
02:54:24,375 --> 02:54:27,041
granted by our brand-new mayor,

2656
02:54:27,125 --> 02:54:30,125
and go out into the light
before he takes it back.

2657
02:54:30,208 --> 02:54:32,416
Out, sinners!

2658
02:54:32,500 --> 02:54:33,916
Once again!

2659
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:38,541
This family is worse than the plague!

2660
02:55:15,416 --> 02:55:21,333
NO TRESPASSING
US-CANADA MINING CO.

2661
02:55:51,250 --> 02:55:54,000
Look, Dad. You were right.

2662
02:55:54,083 --> 02:55:57,000
Grandpa's mine held a mountain of gold!

2663
02:55:58,208 --> 02:56:00,041
What's next, honey?

2664
02:56:03,750 --> 02:56:05,541
Poor Mexico.

2665
02:56:06,541 --> 02:56:10,666
So far from God, and so close to the U.S.

2666
02:56:11,458 --> 02:56:14,625
Fuck you, Pancho Reyes!

2667
02:56:16,958 --> 02:56:21,000
We have no house, no dreams, no hope.

2668
02:56:22,166 --> 02:56:26,625
Meanwhile, that bastard
is living like a king!

2669

Hello, Don Jaime.

2676

Hello, Normita.

2677
02:57:25,416 --> 02:57:30,250
What is it, Pancho? Normita was telling me
you've been trying to meet with me. So?

2678
02:57:30,333 --> 02:57:34,083
First, I'm very grateful
you agreed to see me.

2679
02:57:34,166 --> 02:57:38,583
I'm also grateful for the chance
to keep working here.

02:57:38,666 --> 02:57:41,500
No need. Normita thanked me already.

2681
02:57:41,583 --> 02:57:44,625
She finally let me unbury her treasure,

2682
02:57:44,708 --> 02:57:47,166
and convinced me not to fire you.

2683
02:57:49,666 --> 02:57:51,875
Thank you, Normita.

2684
02:57:53,083 --> 02:57:56,625
- Is that all?
- I also wanted to ask,

2685
02:57:56,708 --> 02:58:00,000
If there's any chance
I can get my old job back.

2686
02:58:00,833 --> 02:58:03,541
Don't give me that bullshit.

2687
02:58:03,625 --> 02:58:07,208
Be grateful I didn't fire you
like you deserved.

2688
02:58:07,291 --> 02:58:09,916
After walking away from your job,

2689
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:13,000
you deserved to have
my shoeprint on your ass.

2690
02:58:13,750 --> 02:58:18,000
Luckily, I sold the company
to the fucking gringos.

2691
02:58:18,083 --> 02:58:20,250
They'll decide what to do with you.

2692
02:58:20,333 --> 02:58:23,625
Could you recommend me
to the new management?

2693
02:58:24,208 --> 02:58:26,958
Maybe ask your mother!

2694
02:58:27,041 --> 02:58:31,083
Or that commie President,
who loves poor people like you.

2695
02:58:31,666 --> 02:58:35,291
Good thing I'm emigrating
before he ruins the country,

2696
02:58:35,375 --> 02:58:37,833
and turns it into Cuba or Venezuela.

2697
02:58:38,750 --> 02:58:41,625
If that's all, fuck off!

2698
02:58:41,708 --> 02:58:45,208
Neither the gringos
nor I pay you to stand around.

2699
02:58:46,791 --> 02:58:48,916
Thank you for the opportunity.

2700
02:58:49,708 --> 02:58:50,833
Thank you, Normita.

2701
02:58:51,833 --> 02:58:53,083
You're welcome, engineer.

2702
02:58:54,041 --> 02:58:56,458
My goodness!

2703
02:58:56,541 --> 02:59:00,708
Don't blame the pig,
blame those who feed it.

2704
02:59:15,416 --> 02:59:17,625
What's happened sir?
See where you ended up?

2705
02:59:18,208 --> 02:59:21,000
What comes up, eventually comes down.

2706
02:59:21,083 --> 02:59:22,333
- So, what?
- What?

2707
02:59:22,416 --> 02:59:23,375
Well, so what?

2708
02:59:38,458 --> 02:59:39,875
- Fuck you!
- Motherfucker!

2709
02:59:44,208 --> 02:59:50,875
GIVE IT UP FOR THE POOR!
AMLO FOR PRESIDENT, AGAIN!

2710
03:00:47,708 --> 03:00:51,125
- Family, I'm home!
- I'm so glad.

2711
03:00:51,208 --> 03:00:55,500
The ceiling caved in, and we have leaks.

2712
03:00:56,208 --> 03:00:58,750
- How did it go?
- Not great.

2713
03:00:58,833 --> 03:01:02,500
I met with Don Jaime,
but he rejected my promotion.

2714
03:01:02,583 --> 03:01:05,666
- Damn it.
- Oh, well. That's life.

2715
03:01:06,458 --> 03:01:08,791
- I have a surprise, right?
- Yeah.

2716
03:01:11,208 --> 03:01:13,750
Surprise!

2717
03:01:15,375 --> 03:01:18,250
What's up, Pancho? What took you so long?

2718
03:01:18,333 --> 03:01:21,333
I hope you don't mind us
getting comfortable.

2719
03:01:21,416 --> 03:01:24,000
We're moving in with you!

2720
03:01:24,083 --> 03:01:26,166
Thank God you made it home safe!

2721
03:01:26,250 --> 03:01:28,208
- Cheers, Pancho!
- Drink some tequila.

2722
03:01:28,291 --> 03:01:31,500
Let's give your family a proper welcome.

2723
03:01:31,583 --> 03:01:33,875
See, Panchito?

2724
03:01:33,958 --> 03:01:38,375
I told you you'd never
get rid of us, fucker!

2725
03:01:38,458 --> 03:01:40,750
Come on, Pancho! Don't be snotty!

2726
03:01:40,833 --> 03:01:43,541
Celebrate with your family,
because for us,

2727
03:01:43,625 --> 03:01:45,916
your failure is our happiness.

2728
03:01:46,541 --> 03:01:49,500
Cheers to that
and long live Mexico, fuckers!

2729
03:01:49,583 --> 03:01:51,375
Hurray!

2730
03:02:11,250 --> 03:02:13,208
Pancho.

2731
03:02:14,125 --> 03:02:15,291
Pancho!

2732
03:02:15,791 --> 03:02:20,291
Pancho, wake up!
You were having a nightmare.

2733
03:02:20,375 --> 03:02:24,541
I had the most terrible, dreadful dream.

2734
03:02:24,625 --> 03:02:27,166
I keep telling you to see a doctor,

2735
03:02:27,250 --> 03:02:28,625
this isn't normal.

2736
03:02:29,125 --> 03:02:33,500
Let me sleep, for fuck's sake.
I have one hell of a hangover.

2737
03:02:42,958 --> 03:02:44,125
Oh, man.

2738
03:02:45,625 --> 03:02:46,583
Jesus.

2739
03:02:50,750 --> 03:02:54,166
Pancho, please! Don't be inconsiderate!

2740
03:02:54,666 --> 03:02:57,375
You're making so much noise
while we're trying to sleep.

2741
03:02:58,000 --> 03:02:59,375
I mean, fuck.

2742
03:11:19,416 --> 03:11:23,916
